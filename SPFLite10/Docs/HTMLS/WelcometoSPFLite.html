<p class="rvps4"><a name="Introduction"></a>
<span class="rvts14">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">SPFLite is a Windows text and source-program editor designed for users who are familiar with the mainframe IBM editor known as SPF, ISPF or ISPF/PDF. These original editors function in a significantly different manner than most Windows-based editors, because they are </span><span class="rvts14">line-oriented</span><span class="rvts13"> and </span><span class="rvts14">command-driven</span><span class="rvts15">.</span><span class="rvts13"> &nbsp;If you've had many years of experience using one editor, changing to another one quite often is disruptive and frustrating.</span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Functions that one is accustomed to are missing or operate totally differently, and the cry is heard, "Where's my good old ISPF ?!"</span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">I went through this frustration years ago, and </span><span class="rvts12">after trying out just about every Windows PC Editor I could lay my hands on, I realized none of them satisfied what I wanted. I looked for other ISPF clones, and discovered that there just isn't much out there. The commercial products (e.g. CTC's version) were </span><span class="rvts11">way</span><span class="rvts12"> out of my price range, and secondly looked like they had been programmed by PC/Windows programmers who were basically clueless about what ISPF was really like. </span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">So, as my wife so bluntly put it, "You've been a programmer all your life, create it yourself!" &nbsp;So that's where this came from.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts24">Enter SPFLite</span><span class="rvts13">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">By the way, before we touch on the history of SPFLite, we'd be remiss if we didn't answer the question most users might be thinking right now, and that is, "Well, an SPF-style editor is great if you are an ex-mainframe developer, but I never was! &nbsp;Why should I care about </span><span class="rvts15">your</span><span class="rvts13"> editor? &nbsp;What's in it for </span><span class="rvts15">me?" </span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The short answer is, a lot. Besides the fact that a line-oriented editor model is actually a very good one when you are writing programs, SPFLite's editing capabilities are now much better, in many ways, than even the most recent mainframe releases of ISPF. </span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts13">Believe it or not, if you have been keeping up with SPFLite's continually improving capabilities, and if you also have opportunity to work on ISPF on a current IBM z/OS system, you may actually find yourself saying the opposite of what George wrote above: "Where's my SPFLite ?!". It's that much better - RH</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">In addition, the latest versions of SPFLite have added many functions and capabilities that help </span><span class="rvts15">bridge the gap</span><span class="rvts13"> between line-oriented editing and character-oriented word processing. So, what's in it for you? &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts15">Lots</span><span class="rvts13">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts13"></span><br/><a name="SPFLiteEvolution"></a>
<span class="rvts11">SPFLite Evolution</span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">I had toyed with ISPF clones from the very early days of personal computers. My first effort was on a 64K (yes, </span><span class="rvts16">K</span><span class="rvts11">) </span><span class="rvts12">TRS-80 and looking back it was pretty pathetic. Next came a ported version on the early PCs, sort of usable, but very, very limited.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">When I retired, I needed something to keep busy with, so I resurrected my old SPF source and started once again. And SPFLite resulted. </span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">It is simply the Editor portion of ISPF with as many of the features and functions of the editor as I could manage to duplicate. A simple File Manager option was added to provide basic file selection and Delete and Rename functions.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Of course, additions and improvements have been ongoing, and the result is now far past the original 'Lite' designation. Not only does SPFLite support almost all of the IBM SPF commands and facilities, but it has extended these significantly in many areas. Some are extensions in capabilities of existing SPF commands, but many are entirely new, powerful additions to the command set.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><a name="Versions1.0thru4.0"></a>
<span class="rvts11">Versions 1.0 thru 4.0</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">Starting as a console-mode application, SPFLite progressed through the conversion to a Windows application, and added multi-tabbed editing, and proper Options/Preferences support so manual editing of INI variables was no longer required. Many ISPF commands and features were implemented.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><a name="Version5.0thru6.2"></a>
<span class="rvts11">Version 5.0 thru 6.2</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">A total keyboard rewrite now allowed almost every keyboard key to be customized. Many new features (Multi-Edit, PowerTyping, Find in Files and Text Highlighting) were added, along with numerous new commands, and keyboard primitives. </span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><a name="Version7.0and7.1"></a>
<span class="rvts11">Version 7.0 and 7.1</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">Introduction of a true programmable macro capability. This supports creation of both new Primary commands and Line commands to accomplish custom editing functions. More new features and commands. User lines were introduced along with supporting commands. STATE support switched away from using ADS files to normal files in the SPFLite folder.</span></p>
<p class="rvps7"><span class="rvts19"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><a name="Version8.0"></a>
<span class="rvts11">Version 8.0</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">Introduced a significantly revised File Manager, both in screen layout and capabilities.. In addition, a major review and revision of SPFLite internal code was completed. Several other enhancements were made: File specific STATE setting, simplification of Line Command aliases, Dynamic colorization was added, &nbsp;an AUTOCAPS mode was made available when editing programming languages where it is desirable to have language keywords uppercased for readability, &nbsp;optional Keyword hi-lighting on the command line, plus other minor enhancements.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><a name="Version8.1"></a>
<span class="rvts11">Version 8.1</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">Several new features were added: Primary command chaining, separation of BROWSE into BROWSE and VIEW commands, a new EXCLUDE command for File Manager to allow filtering of a File List, a new profile option - ACTION - to request automatic SAVE / &nbsp;VSAVE at specified intervals as well as numerous corrections for issues introduced during the V7 to V8 code revision.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><a name="Version8.2"></a>
<span class="rvts11">Version 8.2</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">8.2 consisted mainly of some major internal revisions and restructuring to assist in long term maintenance and reliability. A few minor enhancements were included: &nbsp;Improved File Manager 'nesting' so a return to a prior level will re-display the previous scroll and cursor positions; add a new FM option to allow choosing the location of Directory entries within a list . (Top, bottom, or in-line in alphabetical sequence)</span></p>

<span class="rvts11">Version 9.0</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">This version was never released. It contained a lot of experimental code which never really worked as expected.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><a name="Version10"></a>
<span class="rvts11">Version 10.0</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">A total revision of handling screen colors to integrate the specification of screen item colors and the color specifications within the AUTO colorization files. There had always been inconsistencies between the two making color setup awkward and confusing. This change adds additional Hi-light colors and immediate visual feedback of color choices. Color support was also extended to the PRINT output.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">The status bar size was increased to allow for a larger font size, and the content and layout of the various status bar boxes can now be controlled by the user. This change also increased the size of the Tab Titles.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts12">Some enhancements to Keyboard handling and a new DO command to improve on keyboard macros..</span></p>

<span class="rvts11">A Note about Keyboard Functions</span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">As noted above, IBM ISPF is </span><span class="rvts14">line-oriented</span><span class="rvts13"> and </span><span class="rvts14">command-driven</span><span class="rvts13">, and so is SPFLite. However, a major component of SPFLite - and one of its distinguishing features - is its support for </span><a class="rvts18" href="KeyboardCustomize.html">Keyboard Customization and Keyboard Macros</a><span class="rvts13"> and </span><a class="rvts18" href="ListofKeyboardPrimitives.html">Keyboard Primitives</a><span class="rvts13">. A great deal of SPFLite's power, and what makes it so special, derives from this capability. It is </span><span class="rvts14">just</span><span class="rvts13"> as important to understand and use this feature as it is to understand and use SPFLite's array of primary and line commands.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">If you choose to use SPFLite as if it were "just a PC version of IBM ISPF" without exploring key-mapped functions, there is nothing "wrong" with that, of course. However, you would be missing out on a large number of highly useful and very cool features that can save you time and allow you to do things you couldn't otherwise do, or could only do with great difficulty. </span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Don't miss out! &nbsp;Do yourself a favor, and read up on key mapping and keyboard functions - then try them out. If there's </span><span class="rvts15">anything</span><span class="rvts13"> you don't understand about these functions, and this Help file isn't clear enough, be sure to send us your feedback on the SPFLite Forum. Whether it's a documentation improvement or a feature enhancement that's needed, we do take everyone's feedback into consideration.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Rest assured - the learning curve is well worth the effort.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">P.S. For any of you former Tritus SPF users (I am in that group - RH), who might be familiar with the "keyboard primitives" that Tritus supported, you should be aware that the mappable functions in SPFLite are much more powerful. There are loyal Tritus users who thought they'd "never" give up their favorite editor - which was unquestionably a fine product in its day. If you count yourself among such users, you should know that in terms of sheer editing capability, SPFLite is not only every bit as good as Tritus was, it's </span><span class="rvts14">better</span><span class="rvts13">. SPFLite </span><span class="rvts14">is</span><span class="rvts13"> the successor to Tritus SPF that you have been waiting for! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">This document shows a number of screen shots to help explain how SPFLite operates. Many will appear with a very small screen size just large enough to contain the lines being discussed. This is done only for convenience in preparing the Help document, and nothing else is implied. You are free to adjust your SPFLite screen size to anything that is convenient for you.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">As well, since there are so many screen shots used throughout this document. you will see snapshots created from several different releases of SPFLite. Replacing each and every screen shot with a sample from the current release would be very time-consuming and labor-intensive, and is not usually necessary anyway. Be assured that the purpose of an 'old' screen shot is not lessened because it is from an older release. These are updated as needed if the contents would be misleading. We </span><span class="rvts11">do</span><span class="rvts12"> review every screen shot with every release, and anything that changed in any significant way </span><span class="rvts11">is</span><span class="rvts12"> updated. Don't worry, we've got it covered!</span></p>

<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">SPFLite will operate on Windows 10, Windows 8.0, Windows 8.2, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. Windows XP users must use an older version maintained on the Download page of the SPFLite web site.. As with any other aspect of SPFLite, if you ever run into problems, be sure to send your feedback to the SPFLite Forum so we can look into it. </span></p>

<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">Because the design of SPFLite is largely based on IBM ISPF, it may be helpful to read the specifications for the original mainframe editor for comparison purposes. Documentation of this mainframe software can be found on the Internet. The most important manual for ISPF is the ISPF Edit and Edit Macros Manual. A recent version of this manual online can be found at:</span></p>

<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts12"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts12">SPFLite is distributed as Shareware and all copies and versions are </span><span class="rvts11">fully functional</span><span class="rvts12"> and will remain fully functional even after the trial period has expired. The only difference after the trial period, if you have not registered the program, is that it will randomly 'nag' every few uses as it terminates. I don't like 'nag-ware' either, so I've tried to keep it at a minimum. But you are basically on your honor; if you use it often enough for the nagging to bother you, you also know how to stop the nagging.</span></p>
