Between 6.2.3060 and 6.2.3061 (Mar 02/2013)
===========================================

  * Fixed loss of mousewheel control if a CANCEL out of the Options dialog is
    performed rather than a DONE exit.

  * Corrected handling of SET command with no operands.  It was not opening
    an Edit of all SET variables as it should.

  * Corrected loss of colorize support if running with STATE OFF.


Between 6.1.3024 and 6.2.3060 (Mar 01/2013)
===========================================

  PRIMARY COMMANDS
  ----------------

  * The keywords PREFIX and SUFFIX may now also be abbreviated as PFX and SFX.

  * A new Profile option, MINLEN, defines the minimum length for lines in a
    file.  When MINLEN is greater than zero, whenever the file is edited and
    lines are inserted, modified or copied from the clipboard or from another
    file, the minimum line length will be enforced, by blank-padding any lines
    that are shorter than MINLEN characters.  One reason to use a MINLEN value
    greater than zero is to avoid the existence of zero-length lines, which can
    create certain issues with FIND and CHANGE pictures.

  * The SWAP primary command, which accepts the operands PREV, NEXT and PRIOR,
    now additionally accepts FIRST, LAST, HOME and LIST.  SWAP FIRST will select
    the leftmost file tab.  SWAP LAST will select the rightmost file tab.  SWAP
    HOME will select the File Manager tab.  SWAP LIST will switch to File
    Manager and display the Open FILELIST from which you can choose a tab.

  * The OPTIONS primary command now accepts an optional keyword to select a
    specific tab within the Options Dialog.  The keyword can be used to select
    the General, File Manager, Submit, Screen, Mouse or Keyboard tab.  If this
    new operand is omitted, the General tab is displayed as was done previously.

  * A change Picture of P'!' copies the entire found-string as-is.  Now, you can
    also copy the entire found-string and convert the value to upper or lower
    case.  A change Picture of P'!>' copies a found-string of any length and
    converts it to upper case.  A change Picture of P'!<' copies a found-string
    of any length and converts it to lower case.  If desired, these new Picture
    codes can be shortened using the extended Ansi characters P'»' for P'!>',
    and P'«' for P'!<'.

  * When the =X command followed the CANCEL command, as in CANCEL;=X it now
    operates correctly.  This resolves a prior command parsing issue that
    prevented such command usage from working properly.

  * The LOCATE primary command now accepts a keyword of ALL.  When ALL is used,
    LOCATE does not "locate" any specific line, but is used for the side effect
    of un-excluding excluded lines that meet the the 'condition' described in
    the LOCATE command, such as CHANGE, LABEL or RED.  In addition, the MX
    keyword can be combined with ALL to perform the opposite action, that of
    excluding non-excluded lines that have a given condition.

  * When the BOUNDS primary command is provided a single numeric operand, it is
    taken to be the righthand column boundary, and the lefthand column boundary
    is assumed to be 1.  So, a command of BOUNDS 10 is now legal, and has the
    same effect as BOUNDS 1 10.

  * The CUT primary command now takes a new additional keyword of RAW, which
    will copy one or more lines to the clipboard without an End of Line
    terminator stored for any of the lines, comparable to what the new keyboard
    functions (CopyRaw) and (CopyPasteRaw) do.  Using CUT RAW, it is possible to
    copy a block of lines and have them treated as one long line of text, which
    could then be pasted into an external text editor program such as Notepad,
    which could then treat that block as one continuous flowing paragraph of
    text.


  LINE COMMANDS
  -------------

  * If a numeric-only value is entered into the line command area, it will be
    removed, and the original sequence number will be restored.  Previously, if
    a numeric-only value were entered by mistake, it would not be treated as an
    error, but it would not get deleted either, requiring the user to erase it
    manually.

  * The Text Split line command TS will now accept a line count of 0.  For the
    TS command, the 'n' value represents the number of blank lines inserted, so
    that TS0 means you can split a line without inserting any blank lines in the
    middle of the line you just split.  In addition, a new line command called
    Text Break (TB and TBB) will allow insertion of permanent blank lines (not
    the temporary blank/MASK lines used by TS).  The block mode TBB line command
    may be used to split multiple lines in the same place all at once.  Like TS,
    TB and TBB will accept an 'n' value of 0.

  * A new Text Margin line command, TM and TMM, may be used to reformat one or
    more paragraphs of text, in a manner similar to that of the Text Flow line
    command TF/TFF, except that the operation of TM/TMM is simpler, is less
    sensitive to any non-default BOUNDS settings that might be in effect, and
    will not encounter the types of conflicts with BOUNDS that sometimes occurs
    when using TF/TFF.

  * The Text Flow line command TF/TFF, and the new Text Margin line command
    TM/TMM, will break lines based on 'words' being delimited by blanks or by
    the beginning and/or end of a line.  Previously, SPFLite took into account
    the "Normal characters for P'.' picture literals" (as defined on the Global
    Options/General dialog) to help determine how to break lines apart into
    words; this approach caused problems at times.  The new method is simpler,
    more reliable, and easier to understand.

  * A new Text Selection line command T/TT may be used to select large amounts
    of text for use with keyboard primitive commands that need such defined
    areas of text, such as (PenGreen).  This can be useful in cases where the
    area that needs to be selected is so large that mouse selection or the use
    of shift/arrow keys is not possible or practical.

    Note: The new T/TT command has nothing to do with a prior usage of T/TT,
    which meant, "Take Lines".  That old T/TT line command was removed, as of
    the 6.0 version of SPFLite.  The old usage for T/TT has been superseded by
    more conventional C/CC blocks.

  * The Pad to Length line command PL will now accept a special modifier of
    / or \.  When used in this way, a command of PL/ will pad all following
    lines to a minimum length of 1; PL\ will do the same to preceding lines.
    Placing PL/ on line 1 of a file can be used to ensure that all lines in the
    file have a minimum line length of 1; that is, it is a quick way to ensure
    there are no zero-length lines in the file.


  FILE MANAGER
  ------------

  * A new Global Options tab is available for the File Manager.  This gathers in
    one place all global options relating to the FM, which makes them easier to
    find and modify as needed, rather than having these options associated with
    the General options tab, as was done previously.

  * In File Manager, if an FM line command of the form 'ALL cmd' is entered on
    a FILELIST line, the 'cmd' is applied to every file named in the FILELIST.
    For example, ALL E will open every file for editing that is named in the
    FILELIST, and ALL M will open a Multi Edit session utilizing every file that
    is named in the FILELIST.


  OTHER CHANGES
  -------------

  * Further enhancements to high overhead code areas sensitive to handling large
    files.  Improvements were made in the line insertion / deletion handling as
    well as the saving of data for UNDO support.

  * SPFLite will respect the Read Only attribute of a file.  If an attempt is
    made to EDIT such a file, SPFLite will open the file in BROWSE mode
    instead, and issue a warning message, to prevent inadvertent modification
    of the Read Only file.

  * If enabled by a new General Option checkbox, you can now highlight (select)
    a 2D (multi-line) block of text without using the Shift, Ctrl or Alt keys in
    combination with mouse movement.

  * To prevent users familiar with IBM ISPF from creating invalid line commands
    in KEYMAP, an attempt to define a key with a line command like :R will
    result in a warning popup message advising the user that the command has
    been automatically converted to the SPFLite-compatible equivalent format
    of {R}.

  * You now have finer control on how you are notified of a change to a file
    being edited by SPFLite when it is also modified from an outside source.
    You can continue to be always notified of outside modifications, or to only
    be notified if the file is in an EDIT session but not in a BROWSE session,
    or to not be notified at all.  This control can be set on a permanent,
    global basis or can be temporarily altered as needed.

  * New keyboard functions (CopyRaw) and (CopyPasteRaw) will copy text without
    an End of Line terminator stored.  This can be important if you copy text
    inside of SPFLite and then paste it to an application outside of SPFLite.
    In addition, the CUT primary command will take a new additional keyword of
    RAW which supports a similar capability.

  * Correct a KEYMAP bug, in which a key mapping that defaulted to (Passthru)
    was not getting restored to (PassThru) if it had been mapped to some other
    non-default setting and then erased later.

  * Correct a timing error in UNDO handling when several files are opened
    in rapid succession (as on program startup with a list of previously open
    files).  The error caused diagnostic popup boxes to appear.

  * New options in specifying AUTO colorization file settings.  Previously, the
    non-data areas of the screen (Headings, command line, line numbers etc.)
    were drawn using your normal screen colors.   This sometimes resulted in
    unworkable combinations.  You may now set the color schemes for these
    areas with the new NORMHI, NORMLO, LINEHI and LINELO keywords.


Between 6.1.3004 and 6.1.3011 (Jan 11/2013)
===========================================

  * Correct a long standing bug (since V5.0) which could cause unpredictable
    crashes and/or loops when doing a SAVE (or AUTOSAVE during END processing).
    This only occurred for long running SPFLite sessions which had performed
    numerous file edits/saves.

  * Line command parsing was not correctly recognizing associated primary
    commands if the command line was built using =SET variables.  This is now
    supported.


Between 6.1.2325 and 6.1.3004 (Jan  4/2013)
===========================================

  * The filename operand on the command line may now specify a wild-card file
    specification to request a filtered display of the named folder in the
    initial File Manager display.  e.g. SPFLite C:\Users\Me\Folder\*.BAT

    In addition a simple 'name' as this operand, which also matches an existing
    FILELIST, will be taken as a request for an initial File Manager display of
    the named FILELIST.

  * File Manager will now highlight the line command area where the current
    cursor is located similarly to the way an edit tab highlights the line
    number.  This will make it easier to spot an underline cursor amongst the
    _______ line command fill characters.

  * Performance improvement to the internal module tracing used by crash/loop
    detection reporting.

  * Performance improvements to the loading of large files as well as
    improvements to deleting large line ranges.

  * A detected loop will now offer the option to simply ignore and continue
    execution rather than continue termination. As well, suppression of loop
    detection was added to some additional potential long-running processes.

  * An EDIT request for a non-existent file will now report the error and then
    open it as newly created zero length file.

  * A new macro variable ~V(varname) has been created to allow substitution of
    data from the System Environment variables. e.g. you could fetch the
    system command processor name with ~V(COMSPEC)

  * Correct error which prevented the File Manager LOCATE command from working.

  * Correct error in saving some Options settings.

  * Correct error in handling the SET xxx OFF command.

  * Correct error in UNDO handling of large files.


Between 6.0.2319 and 6.1.2325 (Nov 20/2012)
===========================================

  * Correct saving of File Manager Scroll Amount setting.

  * Correct screen width handling with certain fonts. Calculation error could
    cause width to 'creep' larger with every SPFLite startup.



Between 6.0.2317 and 6.1.2319 (Nov 14/2012)
===========================================

Enhancements
------------

  * Correct broken RFIND command and the REVERSE RFIND option.


Between 6.0.2184 and 6.1.2317 (Nov 12/2012)
===========================================

Enhancements
------------

  * New primary commands SPLIT and JOIN are available to automate splitting
    and joining of lines based on string searches.  An extensive tutorial
    explains these new features.

  * FTP support has been added to File Manager.  You can now edit and browse
    files located on a remote FTP server just as you would do for local files
    and directories.

  * File Manager now contains two additional navigation lines.  A "Recent
    Paths" line which is like the "Recent Files" but for paths.  As well, an
    "Open Files" is present to display files currently open in tabs.  This is
    useful when many tabs are open and not all tab headers are visible due to
    horizontal scrolling of the tab headers.  The "Recent FILELIST" has been
    renamed to the "Recent Files FILELIST".

  * When File Manager lists are created from a FILELIST, you may now also
    specify a File Type mask to selectively display only certain file types.

  * When a file list is created using the MAKELIST command with the SYM option,
    the format of the resulting symbolic file list now causes the file names to
    be displayed in a shorter format without the full path-name qualification.
    This makes the list of files easier to read.

  * The File Manager line command area has been expanded to allow for future
    enhancements to line commands and for commands longer than one letter.
    Several existing commands have been modified to utilize the additional
    line command size.

  * A new FIND command in File Manager support searches for filenames based on
    any string or substring within a path name or file name.

  * FILELIST maintenance functions have been enhanced to better handle the
    addition, removal and rename of filenames in multiple FILELISTs.  This is
    done to prevent inconsistencies when the same file appears in more than one
    FILELIST.

  * Commands initiated by using a Command key (like CHANGE ABC DEF started via
    an RFIND command key) will now be captured in the command stack for use by
    the RETRIEVE/CRETRIEV commands.  This means if you start a FIND or CHANGE
    using RFIND/RCHANGE (usually the F5 or F6 keys), you can retrieve the
    original FIND/CHANGE or other command and run it again.

  * Text marking and Copy/Cut functions may now be performed on the Primary
    Command line as well as in the normal text area, using the shift-Arrows keys
    or the mouse.  This can be useful when you need to paste strings or file
    names into the command area.

  * A new Primary command MARK ON/OFF allows you to suppress the display of MARK
    lines without actually altering the MARK line definition itself.  This is
    similar to the way TABS ON/OFF suppresses tabbing without altering the
    location of the tab locations.

  * CHANGE now supports a new operand, TRUNC, which will cause all remaining
    characters on the line following the new change string to be deleted.

  * A Cancel button has been added to the Options dialog, so you can exit
    without saving any changes if desired.

  * New line shift commands [[ and ]] have been added, which are referred to as
    Indent Shifts, since they shift in terms of INDENT LEVELS.  The size of an
    indent level is determined by the following new item.

  * A new Options -> General entry has been added to allow changing the default
    number of columns to be shifted by the shift line commands (( )) << >> [[
    and ]].

  * The text string keyboard primitive, like [string], when used for creating
    repetitive string values, can now be coded more simply.  The new coding
    also will execute significantly faster.  To generate 20 * asterisks, for
    example, rather than coding [********************] you can achieve the same
    effect by specifying (20:[*]).

  * The TF line command (Text Flow) has been extended for use as the block mode
    command TFF, so that multiple paragraphs can be formatted in a single step.

  * PowerType has been enhanced with the addition of faint vertical lines at the
    cursor column, to better show the cursor location on all the lines included
    in the PowerType process.

  * The SET command will now support PUSH and POP options for the variables.
    The PUSH option will allow macros to temporarily adjust SET variables, and
    then restore the previous value with POP.

  * Private clipboards have been expanded from a fixed list of ten (0 thru 9) to
    an unlimited number of Named Private Clipboards.  A Named Private Clipboard
    can be accessed from primary commands or by new extensions to keyboard
    functions, without involving the normal Windows clipboard as an intermediary
    holding area.

  * The ISPF MASK line command is now supported.

  * Support has been added for "Virtual Highlighting Pens", which allow you to
    highlight text areas similar to how felt highlighting pens are used on paper
    listings.   Four highlight colors are available, and highlighting is
    persistent across edit sessions when STATE saving is enabled.  The exact
    color palette that is displayed by these Virtual Highlighting Pens may be
    tailored to any desired color via the Screen Options dialog.

  * The text SWAP function has been extended to support blocks of text in
    addition to single text line selections.

  * Two new keyboard primitives (DataInsert) and (DataDelete) will now support
    character insertion and deletion which attempts to maintain data column
    alignment when present, in a manner similar to the way a CHANGE command
    performs the same action when FIND / CHANGE strings are of different
    lengths and the changed strings have spans of spaces next to them.

Bug Fixes
---------

  * Correction to COPY command when copying into an (Empty) tab with no A/B line
    command entered. It was basically ignoring the command instead of inserting
    after the Top Of Dataset line.

  * Relax filtering of folders in File Manager so that Hidden and System folders
    will now be processed.

  * Correct error in Line command parsing which could result in a permanent
    loop.

  * Correct error in STATE load of files with labels and/or tags during a COPY
    command.

  * Correct scrolling when an incomplete line command group was present. Also
    remove a duplicate call to an attention routine, pure wasted activity.


Between 6.0.2181 and 6.0.2184
=============================

  * Correct error in Line command processing which could result in false errors
    of "Pending command" following an otherwise perfectly successful line
    command.

  * Correct another error in Line command processing which could trigger a
    variety of false validation errors.


Between 6.0.2096 and 6.0.2181
=============================

Enhancements
____________

  * Finally re-write line command processing so that the need for the UU and TT
    line commands is removed.  All places where UU/TT were used previously will
    now accept the CC/MM (sometimes HH) line commands as equivalents.  This
    returns the use of CC/MM to old favorites such as CUT, CREATE, REPLACE and
    PRINT.

  * Alter UNDO processing so that large files do not cause performance delays
    when creating the UNDO checkpoints.

  * Also to assist large file performance issues, an optional, alternate line
    numbering technique is available.  This method avoids the need for
    frequently renumbering ALL lines in the Edit session.  The downside of this
    is that the visible line numbers are no longer equal to their 'physical'
    line number.  All functions that use these visible line numbers continue to
    work as usual, no differences whatsoever.

    However, if you prefer line numbers = to physical line numbers, a setting
    under Options -> General allows you to specify a file size, in lines, under
    which the old method of numbering is to be used. Setting this value to a
    very large number (e.g 999999) will effectively turn off this new numbering.

  * Mark SPFLite as UAC aware.  When editing files under Vista or Windows 7/8,
    this will prevent Windows from doing UAC Virtualization (AKA Data
    Redirection) and NOT writing the file into it's original location.

    In simple terms this means editing files in Windows protected folders (e.g.
    c:\Program Files\) will not report successful saving, while actually doing
    the save into a C:\Users\.... folder.

    Instead, you will receive a failure message of "File is in use or
    protected".  And you will need to run SPFLite as an Administrator to
    properly save the file in it's protected location.

  * Allow REPLACE command to be used when Browsing a file.

  * When multiple files are re-opened at startup, the initial display will now
    be set to the tab which was active when SPFLite was shut down.

  * Add the current BNDS setting to the status bar.

  * Alter File Watch handling.  If SPFLite does not have the focus when a file
    has been modified externally, it will not report the change till the tab for
    the affected file is given control.

  * For simple cursor left/right functions, make screen column 7 (between the
    line number and the text) into an Auto-Skip type field.

  * There is now a new Global option for BROWSE.  You may now request a warning
    at END time if the Browse session has modified the data.  It will allow you
    to return to Browse and use CREATE or REPLACE to save the data.  Sometimes
    it is too easy to forget you are in Browse, make changes and then lose
    them without warning when END is entered.   See Options => General for the
    new setting.

Corrections
___________

  * Correction to SAVEALL.  It was not properly resetting the Tab Title colors
    to indicate the modified status.

  * Correction to mouse handling.  Incorrect handling of middle mouse button
    clicks could cause mouse-wheel scrolling to be ignored.

  * Correction to EOL command parsing, and validation during file load.

  * Ensure the Options -> Submit -> Working directory does not end with a "\"
    character, remove it if present.

  * Correct SUBMIT handling of filenames that require quotes (embedded blanks).
    This was not working when the command itself was a quoted type.

  * Correct INI value handling of quoted strings to prevent the Windows API
    from inadvertently removing the outer quotes.

  * Correct COPY/PASTE -> BB/BB range when the range occurs right at the top of
    the file.

  * Correct MM -> Overlay type line command combinations which were failing to
    mark the file as being modified.

  * Improve performance in altering line labels and tags.

  * Correct error in UC line command.   It was basically doing nothing if
    active BNDS were set.

  * Correct the display of the 3rd PFKSHOW line, it was overlaying the 2nd line.

  * When in PowerType mode, prevent a mouse click from moving the cursor off
    the PowerType model line.

  * Alter handling of 'Illogical Line Command Group' error so that text
    scrolling is permitted.

  * Correct RCHANGE so it will not proceed unless the most recent search
    function was actually successful.   Previously it was re-using results from
    the last successful search even if the most recent search failed.

  * Correct mouse scrolling on the FM screen.  It was not properly going to the
    last line when FM Help lines were being displayed at the bottom of the
    screen.

  * Ensure CREATE and REPLACE commands update the RECENT FILELIST.  And if the
    RECENT FILELIST is actively displayed in FM tab, refresh the display to
    include the new filename.

  * Correct loading of RECFM F files when saved with an EOL value other than
    NONE.  The deblocking will take into account the length of the EOL
    delimiters.

  * Correct cursor vertical scrolling when in HIDE mode.

  * Correct Left Data Shift ( << or < ) when a word exists at the left boundary
    separated by only one blank from other text in the bounded area.


Between 6.0.2080 and 6.0.2096
=============================

  * FILTER functionality has been enhanced to allow filters to perform actions
    beyond simply modifying text lines and returning them.   Filters now can
    perform customized search functions and can, like the FIND command, cause
    scrolling to a desired line and cursor positioning and hi-lighting of text
    strings.

    Filters can now also act as summarization tools.  e.g. performing some
    calculation based on the input lines, and insertion elsewhere of new text
    lines containing the calculation results.  Think like a SUM function that
    inserts a Total line.

  * Colorize will now properly handle multiple /* */ comment strings on a
    single line.

  * Correct error in SORT. It was incorrectly only selecting input lines
    located from the top displayed screen line onward instead of selecting from
    ALL lines.

  * If the SOURCE format is changed while active Edit data exists, a warning
    will be issued to remind users to SAVE the current data immediately to
    prevent problems reloading in the future.

  * Alter the default key mapping for the keypad, for New users only, to mimic
    the normal, printed, non-Numlock mode key labels.   i.e. Home, End, PgUp,
    PgDn etc.

  * Correct the AUTOSAVE default for any Initial Profile settings to AUTOSAVE
    ON PROMPT.

  * When a Normal or Shifted version of a key in KEYMAP is nulled (""), it
    will be set to (Passthru) rather than (Null) as this is the normal desired
    setting. Also, (Passthru) can no longer be accidentally combined with any
    other key settings.

  * Correct error in (Tab) primitive when display is in Hex mode.

  * Correct handling of columns during a CHANGE command.

  * Correct error in TF line command if a right boundary is specified which is
    smaller than the line indent value. Also correct handling when a long 'word'
    is actually bigger than the left/right bounds allow.

  * Correct error in TAG command syntax checking.

  * Correct action of LOCATE command when a pending line command state exists.

  * If START NEW is set and the .START line is in excluded state at file load
    time, the .START line will be removed from excluded status.

  * Correct cursor positioning in File Manager to properly remain on the last
    line item selected.

  * Correct error in PROF NEW which did not properly use the specified
    profile name.


Between 5.0.1270 and 6.0.2080
=============================


 Major new Functions / Facilities

  * You can now perform Multi-Edit sessions: the ability to edit multiple files,
    at the same time, in the same edit tab.  You begin a Multi-Edit session by
    selecting multiple files from a File Manager list, using the M line command
    on each desired file and then pressing Enter after all files have been
    selected.  When you SAVE or END a multi-edit session, every file in the
    session will be saved at the same time.  See "Working with Multi-Edit
    Sessions" in the Help file for more information.

  * File Manager now supports named collections of files, and refers to these
    collections as FILELISTS.  A FILELIST is itself a text file containing a
    list of file names of interest to you.  A FILELIST is retained between
    SPFLite sessions.  There are a number of pre-defined FILELIST names, and
    you may also create your own named FILELISTs as needed.  There is a RECENT
    list, having the most recently opened files (up to a user-specified maximum
    number).  There is a standard FAVORITE list of files you want to be
    remembered as favorites, and you can create you own private, named favorites
    as well.  For example, you can create a "Project" FILELIST containing all
    files for some project, even if these files reside in different folders.

  * The new primary command SUBMIT provides the ability to submit an edit file
    to an external process (which may be an executable program or batch file) in
    a manner similar to the ISPF SUBMIT command.  The facility is flexible
    enough to be usable in a wide variety of applications.  It is expected that
    a principle use of the SUBMIT command will be to submit jobs for execution
    on mainframe systems operating under control of the Hercules emulator
    program.  The SPFLite 6.0 installation includes the utility program
    SPFSUBMIT.EXE which may be used to submit jobs from SPFLite to a Hercules
    emulated card reader device using Socket I/O.  SUBMIT can be issued from an
    Edit, Browse or Clipboard session.

  * A new primary command FILTER allows a range of lines to be filtered through
    an external process and then returned to the edit file.  This allows the
    user to apply data transformations to a file using any desired utility
    program, without leaving the SPFLite edit session.  A sample filter program,
    ReverseLines, has been included with SPFLite, to give you an example of what
    you might do with filters.  This new function effectively now allows users
    to code macros in any scripting language which allows use of re-directed
    Input/Output or named input/output files.

  * A new edit primary command PTYPE allows Power Typing, a way to perform
    simultaneous editing multiple lines of text in parallel.(Some editors refer
    to this as "column mode editing".)  A number of keyboard primitive commands
    have been added, and enhanced, to support Power Typing.  See the Help
    article, Working with Power Typing Mode, for more information.

  * A new primary Find in Files command FF, only available for use in File
    Manager, provides the ability to search through a list of files for the
    presence (or absence) of a particular string.  The operation will return a
    list of the files which match the search criteria.  The list can be used to
    initiate Edit/Browse of those files, or to use as the basis for further
    searches of other different string criteria.  A Find in Files search returns
    a FILELIST, for which you can perform any commands that can be done on any
    FILELIST.

  * NOTE lines are now supported.  NOTE lines are non-data text lines
    that may contain any desired user comments.  NOTE lines are not part of the
    data file per se, and do not have line numbers.  New, blank NOTE lines are
    created with the NOTE line command.  Data lines can be Made into Notes using
    the MN line command, and note lines can be Made into Data lines with the MD
    line command.  You can also convert the special lines that appear in a
    PROFILE display into NOTE lines or data lines.  See the Help article,
    Working with Notes, for more information.


 New and Enhanced Primary Commands

  * The CANCEL primary command now accepts two new operands, DELETE (DEL) or
    PURGE.  They will, after terminating the Edit, cause the underlying file to
    be deleted (sent to the Recycle Bin if that option activated) or purged
    (bypassing the Recycle Bin, even if that option is enabled).

  * A new command START, supports the PROFILE option which allows you to control
    how a file is positioned when opened.  You can choose FIRST (top of file);
    LAST (bottom of file); USER (position to a user entered label of .START);
    NEW (like USER, but the .START label is always moved to the last line on
    file on close); or OFF (effectively like FIRST).  It is expected that START
    NEW will be useful in viewing SYSOUT files, possibly in conjunction with the
    EOL AUTO feature.

  * New LOCATE options, FIND and CHANGE, will locate lines which have been
    previously changed by a FIND, CHANGE or similar command.  All other LOCATE
    options such as FIRST, LAST etc.  are supported as usual.  In addition, a
    new keyword CURRENT, abbreviated as CURR) may be used with LOCATE FIND or
    LOCATE CHG to locate the line that was most recently found or changed.
    LOCATE LONG allows lines to be found that exceed a size operand or exceed
    the LRECL value (when not zero), and LOCATE SIZE locates lines that are
    exactly a certain length.  LOCATE NOT LONG and LOCATE NOT SIZE are also
    allowed.

  * The primary commands that change the exclusion status are now "unified".
    This means that EXCLUDE, FLIP, SHOW, NEXCLUDE, NSHOW and NFLIP all have the
    same underlying syntax and take the same operands as EXCLUDE does, including
    the optional string argument.  As a result of this change, FLIP,  which used
    to apply to all lines by default, now requires the ALL keyword for this
    action to occur.

  * The SORT primary command now performs a "stable" sorting operation; this
    maintains the original ordering of data lines when the sort keys are
    considered equal.

  * FIND and CHANGE can now utilize regular-expression search-strings when the
    search direction is specified as LAST or PREV.  When this is done, the
    search is limited to the left-most only occurrence of the search string.
    Additionally, there are now no restrictions to using PREV, LAST, PREFIX or
    SUFFIX with Picture search strings, which now also performs better.

  * A new primary command EXIT or =X allows SPFLite to be closed, which is
    functionally the same as clicking the X button in the upper-right corner of
    the SPFLite window.  The command =X is an abbreviation for EXIT.

  * A new edit primary command RENAME allows the currently-edited file to be
    renamed while being edited.  When issued, RENAME will cause a Rename popup
    to be displayed, which asks for a new file name.

  * A new primary command RELOAD will discard any unsaved changes in the current
    edit file and then reload the file from its current contents on disk.  If
    any unsaved changes exist, a popup will ask for confirmation of the Reload.

  * FIND, CHANGE and similar commands will now report the number of lines in
    which a string is found or changed, in addition to the number of times the
    string itself is found.

  * PRESERVE C.  New option C to PRESERVE command causes trailing blanks to be
    retained except when the last non-blank character on the line is a \
    backslash.  This is intended for use in C-like languages that use \ for line
    continuation and do not allow blanks to follow it.

  * As a companion to the UNDO command, there is now a REDO command.  Sometimes
    when doing repeated UNDO commands to reach a previous edit status, it is
    easy to UNDO more than intended.  REDO allows you to reapply changes,
    effectively reversing the UNDO.

  * A new TAG option of SET operates much like TAG ON, except that lines not
    eligible to have the new tag assigned will have any old tag cleared.  This
    allows a line range to get a new tag without the need to pre-clear the line
    range of old tags beforehand.

  * When the DELETE command is used to delete the entire edit file by using the
    ALL option, DELETE cannot be abbreviated as DEL.  This is a safeguard to
    prevent deleting the entire file by accident, in case an X|NX option or line
    labels should have been used but were forgotten.

  * PROFILE EDIT profile-name allows editing of any existing Profile, either
    from an Edit session or from the File Manager.  As well, the PROFILE NEW
    profile-name may be issued either from an Edit session or from the File
    Manager.  For both commands, the SPFLite Profile Editor window is displayed
    so that the Profile information can be created or changed.

  * A new primary command COMPRESS can be used to compress repetitive spans of
    strings down to single occurrences.

  * A new REVERSE operand on RFIND, RLOCFIND and RLOC allows repeated FIND or
    LOCATE operations to be done in the direction opposite to the initial
    direction.  This allow you to ‘change your mind’ as to the search direction
    without having to re-issue the original FIND or LOCATE command.

  * You can now perform a virtual save operation during the course of editing a
    file, using the new primary command VSAVE.  A virtual save will save the
    edit session to a temporary file, without committing the edit changes to the
    permanent file you started editing.  If you are editing a critical file and
    experience a system outage, the VSAVE files can be used to resume editing,
    while if the edit ends normally, the VSAVE files are automatically deleted.

  * Duplicate adjacent lines can now be deleted with the new primary command
    DELETE DUP.  DUP is now a reserved word on the DELETE command, so if you
    wish to delete lines that contain a literal of DUP it must be quoted like
    'DUP'.

  * The new LEFT and RIGHT operands of FIND and CHANGE allow strings to be
    searched for and changed at most once per line.  Either the left-most or
    right-most string is found on a line, and any additional occurrences of the
    same string are ignored.

  * A new primary command SAVEALL saves every open edit file.  SAVEALL by
    itself will unconditionally save all edit files, whether currently in a
    modified state or not.  SAVEALL COND will save all edit files that are in  a
    modified state, but unmodified edit files will not be saved.  SAVEALL will
    not save files opened in browse mode, even if such browsed files are in a
    temporarily modified state.

  * The COPY primary command now supports the full ISPF syntax for COPY,
    including BEFORE and AFTER keywords and start/end line numbers for copied
    file.  The copied lines may replace an existing block of line if they are
    marked as a UU or TT block, if the BEFORE / AFTER option is omitted.

  * The PASTE command now also permits the BEFORE/AFTER option as well as ERASE
    to clear the clipboard after the operation.

  * Enhancements have been made to primary command RETRIEVE processing.  The
    RETRIEVE ‘command stack’ will now hold the last 50 commands.  A new RETF
    command will retrieve commands in the ‘forward’ direction, as opposed to the
    'backward' direction done by RETRIEVE; the command stack can be cleared by
    RESET RETRIEVE.

  * The APPEND primary command will insert a string at the end of every line in
    a line range.  The complementary PREPEND primary command will insert a
    string in column 1 of every line in a line range.

  * The PRINT SETUP command can now define "formatted printing" of pages with
    page numbers, headers and footers, file names, and other variable
    information inserted.

 New and Enhanced Line Commands

  * The =TABS> line may now use a + character as a "repeating virtual tab"
    position.  If used, the + may appear only once as the last code on the
    =TABS> line, and must be preceded by an * tab code.  Using the distance in
    columns between the + code and the last * code that precedes it, ‘virtual’
    tab positions are implied indefinitely to the right, starting in the column
    where the + appears.

  * The K (Keep) line command modifier, and the -/+ (post-exclude and
    post-unexclude) line command modifier, can now coexist for the line commands
    A, B, C/CC, O/OO, and OR/ORR.   On CC, OO and ORR the block-header lines
    themselves will not be excluded or unexcluded by the -/+ modifier, but only
    the lines within those blocks.

  * The MARK line command now allows codes < and > to more accurately place the
    column marker lines, in addition to the * code which remains available.

  * G/GG and J/JJ are now defined as ‘physical’ glue and join operations that do
    not involve data trimming.  To trim data before gluing or joining, the new
    line command TG/TGG and TJ/TJJ are now supported.  Additionally, for the
    Glue commands G/GG and TG/TGG, a user-defined string can be specified to
    insert in between the glued lines, using the GLUEWITH command.

  * Two separate blocks of text may now be swapped by marking one block with
    M/MM and the other block with the new Swap line command W/WW.

  * A new Overlay/Replace line command OR/ORR is similar to the standard Overlay
    line command, but will unconditionally overlay data from the 'sending’ lines
    to the ‘receiving’ lines.

  * New keyboard primitive functions (FindNext) and (FindPrev) will find the
    next or previous text that is currently highlighted.  These actions are
    typically performed in other text editors using the keys Ctrl-F and/or F3,
    and may be mapped in SPFLite to any desired key.


 New and Enhanced Keyboard Primitives

  * A piece of text on one line can now be swapped with another (non -
    overlapping) piece of text on the same line or on another line by using the
    new keyboard primitive function (Swap).

  * New keyboard primitive functions (Edit) and (Browse) allow you to directly
    jump into a file for editing or browsing through a highlighted a file name.
    For example, suppose Alt-E is mapped to (Edit).  Then you would highlight a
    file name and press Alt-E.  This causes that highlighted file to be opened
    up in a new Edit tab.

  * A new keyboard primitive command (ToggleHome) will toggle the position of
    the cursor between column 1 and the first non-blank character of the line.

  * The (SetInsert) and (ResetInsert) primitives have been enhanced to save the
    existing insert-mode state internally prior to changing it.  A new primitive
    called (RestoreInsert) takes the insert-mode state saved by the most recent
    (SetInsert) or (ResetInsert) and restores it.  If neither (SetInsert) nor
    (ResetInsert) have yet been performed, (RestoreInsert)  does not change the
    insert mode from its current setting.  These new and enhanced functions are
    useful in keyboard macros that need to modify the insert mode a certain way
    and then restore it to what it was previously.

  * New  keyboard primitive commands (JustifyL), (JustifyR) and (JustifyC)
    enable you to left-justify, right-justify or center (center-justify) a span
    of highlighted text.  The Justify commands act by removing spaces from one
    side of the highlighted text, and adding it to the other side of it.  When
    Power Typing mode is in effect, and a span of text is highlighted on the
    first line, these commands will apply the justification to every line in
    range of the Power Typing command.

  * A new keyboard primitive function (Ansi) will display a 16 by 16 grid of
    characters which may be used to insert any characters into the clipboard,
    including ones not currently mapped to a key.  The same display may be
    accessed in the KEYMAP window, by clicking a new button, "Show ANSI
    Character map".

  * New keyboard primitives (ScrollLeft), (ScrollRight), (ScrollUp) and
    (ScrollDown) allow the screen to be scrolled while leaving the cursor in its
    current location.

  * A new keyboard primitive (ClipClear) will clear the contents of the
    clipboard.
  * Keyboard functions can take a repetition factor so that if you
    need a function run several times, it only needs to be specified once.


 New and Enhanced Mouse Support

  * When a file tab is clicked with the right mouse button, it closes the file
    in the same way that the END command does.  The PROFILE option AUTOSAVE is
    handled in the same way as is done for END.

  * Previously, the mouse could be used to highlight a section of a single line
    (a 1-dimensional highlight) or a square block of text  (a  2-dimensional
    highlight).  Now, you must hold the Shift key when doing a 2-dimensional
    highlight, while 1-dimensional highlighting is done without the Shift.  This
    change means that 2-dimensional highlighting will not occur accidentally but
    only when intended, and makes normal highlighting easier and faster.

  * There are enhanced capabilities available with highlighted text; see the
    Help for more information.

  * You may now perform a ‘word select’ by double-clicking on a word, and
    highlighted text may be deleted and replaced with new text in one step,
    which is especially useful when Insert Mode is on.

  * When you hold down the Ctrl key while using the mouse wheel, the number of
    lines or columns moved is increased by a factor of 4; this is termed Turbo
    Motion.

  * When using a 3-button mouse, the middle mouse button may now be mapped in
    the same way as the left and right buttons.  In addition to allowing use of
    all three mouse buttons, you may now use any combination of Shift, Ctrl and
    Alt, for a total of eight possible mappings for each button.  And defining
    these mouse definitions is simpler, as they are now part of the KEYMAP
    facility, meaning an easy, one-step process just like keyboard keys are
    defined.


 Cosmetic / Interface Changes

  * Previously, when a file was Saved by an END command, the normal "File Saved"
    message would never appear since the Edit tab itself was removed as part of
    END processing.  To ensure that you do receive a notification that the file
    was indeed saved, the message "File Saved" will appear in the message area
    of the status line, as a reminder that the automatic save took place.  This
    message will disappear as soon as any key is pressed.

  * When the scroll amount field is blanked out for any reason, the default
    scroll amount will be restored without an error message being displayed.

  * The File Manager has new and updated primary and line commands, and has been
    reformatted to make it more functional, easier to use, easier to read, and
    with less clutter that allows more useful information to fit on the screen.
    See the section on Working with the File Manager for complete details.

  * A change has been made in the way screen colors are applied to file tabs.
    In prior versions, the Active and Inactive tabs had both a foreground color
    and a background color option available.  With version 6.0, the background
    color is settable for both Active and Inactive tabs, but now the foreground
    color is decided based on whether the file is in a Modified or Unmodified
    state.  The former use of (M) to indicate modified status was removed.  For
    the File Manager tab, and tabs in GUI windows like SPFLite Global Options,
    the foreground text color used will be the same as the Tab Text - Unmodified
    Files color.

  * The visual spacing of messages in the multi-use status box (where "KB
    Recording" appears), and the "scroll progress bar" which appears below it,
    have been adjusted slightly so as not to overlap, so that when both are
    present the message portion is easier to read.

  * A new Option is available, Visual BEEP.  This provides a short visual
    'blink' when an error occurs that would normally trigger an Audible BEEP.
    For users that turn Audible BEEP off because it is disturbing, or for users
    that are hearing-impaired, this provides an alternative.  Audible and Visual
    BEEPs may be activated independently from each other.  As well, the audible
    BEEP is now produced as the standard Windows 'Asterisk' sound and can
    therefore be enabled, disabled and/or customized as desired through the
    "Sounds and Audio Devices" option in the Windows Control Panel.

  * The installation process for SPFLite will now add a Windows Explorer context
    menu item that says, "Open with SPFLite".  This will allow a file to be
    quickly opened by SPFLite for editing by right-clicking on the mouse.   At
    present, if you uninstall SPFLite, the uninstall process will not remove
    this context menu item; it can be manually removed by right-clicking on the
    RemoveOpenWithSPFLite.reg file and selecting Merge.

  * SPFLite will no longer steal the Windows focus back to itself when it is
    not the currently active task, and a file it is editing is modified by some
    outside application.  SPFLite will now wait to notify you about the outside
    file modifications until you again click on SPFLite to make it the active
    task.  This change makes it easier to use SPFLite collaboratively with other
    software, such as a compiler IDE or debugger, which may also have their own
    editing facilities.

  * In File Manager, the END command will now return to the parent directory, or
    to the prior FILELIST, of the currently displayed one.  The same action will
    occur if you right-click the File Manager tab.


 Performance Enhancements

  * A change was made in the way SPFLite detects and responds to keystrokes in
    Repeat mode vs non-Repeat mode.  The change allows SPFLite to process
    keystrokes more quickly and reliably, and prevents certain types of key
    combinations from being misinterpreted if typed at very high speeds.  When a
    mapped key has the Repeat checkbox left blank, the key is now acted upon
    during "key-down time" instead of during "key-up time" so there is no longer
    a latency in responding to these keys.

  * The code used when searching for Picture strings has been totally redone.
    It is now 4-5 times faster and also now allows reverse searching.  i.e.
    using the PREV or LAST operands of Find/Change.

  * Within the Key Map window, you can now jump from one of the eight various
    definitions (with or without Shift, Ctrl and/or Alt) of a key to another by
    using the Tab and Back-Tab keys.  This reduces the need to frequently switch
    between the mouse and keyboard when entering many definitions for the same
    physical key.


 Miscellaneous Changes

  * It is now possible to have deleted files either sent to the Windows Recycle
    Bin or immediately deleted, based on new CANCEL command options and new
    handling of File Manager line commands D and U.  The default action when
    files are deleted is controlled by a new global option checkbox, Delete to
    Recycle Bin.

  * Two new codes for Picture literal searches have been created; the P'%',
    which indicates the "special" characters defined in the DLMS setting; and
    P'@', which indicates all character NOT in the DLMS setting.  i.e.  the two
    types used to define a WORD in string searches.

  * As well, you can now 'escape' a character in a picture code which might be a
    defined picture code like @ by prefixing it with a \ (e.g.  P'\@') When ‘x’
    is a letter, it is matched literally including case, even when CASE T is in
    effect.

  * The new change Picture/Format code of P'!' or F'!' is used to represent the
    entire found search string value, regardless of that string’s length.  The
    !  code can be used more than once, which would cause the found string value
    to be replicated as many times as there are !  codes.  To use an actual  !
    in a change Picture or Format as a literal value, it must be escaped as
    P'\!' or F'\!'.

  * You can now create SET symbols and reference them in an edit session.
    Symbols are created with the SET command or in a SET edit session, and may
    be used in primary commands with the notation =NAME.

  * The Enumerate Facility allows a selected set of columns in a range of lines
    to be enumerated, that is, sequenced starting from an initial value on the
    first line and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent line, within a fixed
    field on a set of lines.  Enumeration requires that Power Typing mode is be
    enabled, and one or more columns on the first line of the Power Typing line
    range are highlighted.  Enumerated values may be in decimal or hex and are
    unsigned.  When these conditions are true, one of the Enumerate keyboard
    primitive commands (Enum), EnumHexLc) or (EnumHexUc),  can be issued.
    Increments other than 1 can also be used.

  * A new set of End of Line profile options, EOL AUTO/AUTONL allow for
    automatic detection of  line terminations, possibly containing inconsistent
    and spurious line terminators, so that files edited across different system,
    mainframe SYSOUT files, and other inconsistently-terminated text files can
    be opened, viewed and edited in a reasonable way.  EOL AUTO/AUTONL may be
    applied to non-mainframe files as well, to handle situations where a file’s
    line termination is inconsistent for some reason.    A possible cause of
    this is a file shared between Windows and Unix on a network and edited with
    different editors applying different line endings.

  * SPFLite now supports Private Clipboards. Ten are provided for and are
    referred to as CB0 thru CB9.   The clipboards are Global (shared amongst
    all active Edit tabs) and are also Permanent (saved and restored between
    SPFLite sessions. These are ideal for storing a variety of boilerplate type
    text.  New keyboard primitives are available for moving clipboard data
    between the normal Windows clipboard and these new Private clipboards. These
    primitives can be easily used to create a coordinated 'set' of keyboard macros
    to access this new support.  The default keyboard definitions contain
    Copy and Paste macros set up on the 0-9 keys.


Between 5.0.1232 and 5.0.1270
=============================

  * Correct checking of PROFILE STATE.  It was being done after the check for
    the NTFS status of the drive rather than before.
 
  * Pending line controls (e.g. A/B) were not being correctly detected by
    primary commands like COPY issued from macros.
 
  * Line command processing was not properly detecting incomplete block
    commands followed by Immediate commands.
 
  * UU block line commands with the K (keep) modifier were not being properly
    retained following their use in a command.
 
  * CANCEL command could not be issued if there were line commands in 'Pending'
    status.
 
  * SAVE issued for a file with zero lines in it was incorrectly skipping the
    actual writing of the empty file.
 
  * The Tab expansion using the IMPORTTABS value was not correctly expanding
    text when only 1 character followed the Tab character.
 
  * A replacement EBCDIC.TXT file to alter the EBCDIC <-> ANSI translation was
    not being properly recognized during initialization.


Between 5.0.1221 and 5.0.1232
=============================

  * If a file save is done as part of closing a tab, the "File Saved" message
    will be displayed for a short time in the status bar of the next tab to be
    displayed.
 
  * The file extension inserted by the substitution string ~X will remain in
    normal case rather than being forced to Upper case.
 
  * Keyboard routines were enhanced to better handle keys flagged as
    non-repeating in keymap.  This should eliminate possible dropped keys when
    the key is a 'chorded' key.  (Like Crtl-Z,   Alt-U, etc.)
 
  * The horizontal scroll bar in the status line has been altered so that it
    does not interfere with character text shown in the same status bar box.
 
  * SPFLite can now automatically check for a new version update on a regular
    basis.  Whether to do this, and the interval to use (7 or 30 days) are
    settable now by a new option under Options -> General.  The Options tab
    also contains a button which will perform an immediate check.  The initial
    setting for this until you choose will be to never check automatically.
 
  * Instead of imposing a fixed key-mapping for the critical ENTER and NEWLINE
    keys, an initial install of SPFLite will provide a pop-up menu to choose
    between three suggested key mappings.  This will prevent the all too common
    problem for new users of forgetting where the ENTER key is mapped.
    Regardless of which choice is made, these settings may be modified later
    via the KEYMAP function.
 
  * The new commands FIND WORDS and FIND CHARS can be used to set the default
    "search context".  This is useful if you frequently search for strings on a
    WORD basis, so that the WORD operand can be omitted on FIND and CHANGE
    commands.  When the default search context is set to WORDS, a W will appear
    in the C/T indicator on the status line that shows the current CASE C/T
    mode.



Between 5.0.1208 and 5.0.1221
=============================

  * File Manager was not 'forgetting' the file list position when display
    criteria had altered.
 
  * RCHANGE was not reacting to a previous search if it was invoked via the
    RLOCFIND command ather than RFIND.
 
  * Certain combinations of keyboard primitives in a keyboard macro were
    leaving remnants of the previous cursor behind.
 
  * Entering a full CHANGE command and pressing RCHANGE was not being honored.
 
  * Tab and BackTab handling on the Top/Bottom of data lines was not being
    handled correctly.
 
  * Handling of the Profile option IMPORTTABS was not being done properly when
    IMPORTTABS was set to 0 to suppress tab expansion.
 
  * Selecting a directory name in File Manager to switch to that directory was
    not being done properly.  An embedded blank was being inserted into the
    path.  Bug introduced by build 1208 inadvertently.
 
  * Mapping of the KP-Enter key was not being handled correctly.
 
  * Possible data corruption when loading files over 128K in size.
 
  * If Profile STATE is ON, and the file is being saved to drive which is not
    using the NTFS file system, a warning that STATE information will not be
    saved is generated.  All other normal save activities continue as normal.
 
  * Add additional Icon sizes for the SPFLite5 program icon to display properly
    at different screen desktop resolutions and icon size settings.


Between 5.0.1195 and 5.0.1208
=============================

  * File Manager was not handling file masks with trailing * properly.

  * Add additional validation to BNDS setting when loading a file Profile.

  * RESET command was not always clearing previous error message text.

  * Correct handling of Enter key when NumLock is ON. (i.e. by toggling it with
    Shift-NumLock.

  * RESET was not being processed if there were outstanding line command errors.
    It should always be performed regardless of such errors.

  * Cosmetic changes to several messages.

  * Corrected handling of shutdown when modified, unsaved new files are being
    processed.

  * Pending line commands were suppressing the action of scrolling commands
    such as LOCATE, FIND etc.

  * Clarify STATE error message when file changes prevent re-establishing the
    previous STATE environment.

  * Editing of a new file type was not properly picking up the DEFAULT
    profile's parameters.  As well, new profiles will start as UNLOCKED.

  * CAPS ON processing was not being properly handled in INSERT mode.

  * Correct formatting of the PROFILE NEW dialog.  Some fields were not spaced
    properly.

  * File manager will now handle file names with leading blanks.   However, use
    of such names is discouraged as it can be very confusing.

  * Cursor performance improved during rapid cursor movement. It will now be
    much more visible than before.    Cursor also will no longer 'disappear'
    when the user has the Windows cursor blink rate set to 'Off'.

  * Altered the test for SPFLite residing on a removable drive when installed
    in 'portable' mode.  Windows basic device type API insisted that a USB
    connected hard drive was not removable.  Another API was found that acted
    more reasonably.


Between 5.0.1189 and 5.0.1195
=============================

  * FIND and CHANGE were treating quoted "*" and unquoted * operands as the
    same, they were both being treated as 'previous operand'.

  * Line commands inserted by keyboard customization settings were not being
    honored on '''''' inserted lines.

  * Documentation updated to describe keyboard customization when using non
    English keyboard which require use of the AltGr key to create national
    characters. Also corrected typo error in the Help file and Tutorial related
    to TAG handling.

  * Termination did not always provide the option to save a tabs data if the
    tab had never been saved.  i.e. was still marked as (Empty) even though
    text lines existed.

  * PASTE into an empty file did not 'clean up' an optional A/B line command
    if it had been entered.


Between 5.0.1186 and 5.0.1189
=============================

  * Keymap will no longer accept changes that leave the ENTER key undefined as
    this makes further use of SPFLite impossible.

  * Global BOUNDS or BNDS settings were not being correctly honored by Primary
    commands like FIND/CHANGE.  Boundaries were only being honored if they
    were specified on the commands themselves.

  * If specified bounds were included on a primary command, SPFLite was not
    allowing an arbitrary large value to be used for the right boundary which
    was larger than the current maximum length record.  For example, specifying
    FIND P'^' 73 1000 on a file with all records under length 100 was rejected.

  * Data entry in the Scroll amount field (upper right) was not being handled
    properly.

  * The Keypad DEL key was not functional.

  * The Keypad Enter key incorrectly had a default assigned of RCHANGE.

  * UP and DOWN commands were incorrectly calculating the new screen position
    when excluded lines were present.

  * Multiple adjacent ranges of excluded lines were not being 'collapsed' in
    to one range following a line delete command.

  * File Manager was not handling Directories with very long names if the name
    was being abbreviated to fit a narrow screen display.


Between 4.4.9 and 5.0.0
=======================

  * Support added for EBCDIC input and output files, along with the EBCDIC NL
    character X'15' as another EOL delimiter character.  In addition, you may
    now specify an LRECL value to specify that the file contains records with a
    fixed Logical RECord Length.

  * When editing EBCDIC files, conversion is done between Ansi code page MS-1252
    (used for the editor display) and EBCDIC code page 1140 for user data files.

  * When a non-zero LRECL is specified, you may also specify an EOL of NONE, to
    indicate that none of the usual end of line delimiters are being used.  The
    combination of a non-zero LRECL and EOL NONE is used to edit files that are
    a set of fixed-length records stored as a continuous stream of bytes with no
    line delimiters at all.

  * Persistent storage of the labels, tags and line exclude status between Edit
    sessions.  You can now close a file, and resume editing it at another time,
    with your file's edit session conditions restored to the same state it had
    at the time it was closed.  This feature is enabled with a new PROFILE
    option called STATE.

  * Add automatic cleanup of stray recovery files that may have been left behind
    in the event of an SPFLite crash.

  * A change was made to the naming standard for Automatic Colorization files.
    These files now have names like "type.AUTO", where "type" is the filename
    extension that defines the file's type.  Use of a "type.AUTO" Automatic
    Colorization file is enabled by a PROFILE command of HILITE AUTO ON.
    Automatic Colorization files are "linked" to to the file's PROFILE.  This
    means that when a PROFILE USE is in effect, a common colorization scheme can
    be defined for a group of related file types.  Support for the former
    PROFILE ALIAS command has been removed.

  * Allow use of temporary line labels in commands.  Temporary labels are
    .labels where the label value is a numeric line number; to reference line 10
    in this way, a temporary line label of .10 could be used.  This allows line
    ranges to be used in commands which also support column ranges (like FIND
    and CHANGE) without needing to assign some permanent labels to the lines
    just for the sake of that command and then having to delete them later.

  * New KEYMAP command and totally rewritten keyboard mapping support.  The
    whole concept of PFKs has been replaced (don't worry, it's actually
    simpler), Now, the commands you desire are actually associated with the key,
    rather than the former two-stage process of associating a keyboard key with
    a PF key, and then associating the PF key with an SPF command.  As well, the
    mapping allows for mapping of all control key combinations for the allowable
    keys (this is sometimes referred to as "chords").  There are 8 variations of
    each key allowed: Normal, Shift, Control, Alt, Shift-Control, Shift-Alt,
    Shift-Control-Alt, and Control-Alt.

    These are now easily managed by a new graphic dialog which allows you to
    click on a keyboard image to access the commands associated with each key.

    As well, support is now provided for keyboard macros.  This includes a new
    Keyboard Recording function to assist in creating these macros.  While
    Keyboard Recording is in progress, a message of "KB Recording" will appear
    on the status line.

  * Separate file option preferences for each file type.  Many formerly global
    preferences are now settable by file type.   The PREFERENCES command is now
    renamed to OPTIONS, and a new PROFILE command is used to display the file-
    oriented options.  Setting of individual PROFILE options is done via primary
    commands as in the original ISPF, such as CAPS, TABS, HILITE, etc.

  * The PFSHOW feature now allows specification of 1 to 5 lines at the bottom of
    the screen.  Only keys which have PFSHOW labels defined (via the KEYMAP
    facility) will appear in this area.  The PFSHOW screen functionality is now
    being handled as an OPTIONS|SCREEN setting, and the former PFSHOW primary
    command is no longer supported.

  * The status line is no longer optional, and now appears as a conventional
    Windows-style status line at the bottom of the screen.  The redesigned
    status area contains many new, useful fields in a concise, ease-to-read
    format.

  * The primary commands OPEN and EDIT have been swapped to have consistent
    meaning with other commands.  BROWSE starts a browse tab, EDIT starts an
    edit tab, and OPEN will now open a new instance of SPFLite.

  * The primary command CRLF has been renamed to EOL (End-Of-Line) to better
    reflect its meaning.  As well, the operands have been renamed from
    WIN/UNIX/MAC to CRLF/LF/CR to also better reflect their meaning.  Also added
    is the ability to use a user specified 1 or 2 byte hex string as the
    delimiter.  The EBCDIC NL character (X'15') is also now available, as is
    the ability to say EOL NONE to have no delimiters at all, which requires a
    specified LRECL value to delimit lines by their length alone.

  * The sort criteria for the File Manager may be quickly changed by
    left-clicking on the column headings.  If currently sorted on the clicked
    column, the sort will switch direction (a + will appear next to the column
    heading for ascending order, and - will appear for descending order).  If
    clicked on a different column, it will switch to an ascending sort on that
    column.  In addition, a new option to sort on file extension has been
    added.  As a result, the SORT type entry line at the top of the screen has
    been removed.

  * File Manager has altered the file type criteria from being a simple list of
    file types, to using the Windows standard file masking characters.  For
    example, previously you might have had criteria like txt;BAS;CPP which would
    now be entered as *.txt; *.BAS;*.CPP.   But more importantly, you can now
    enter criteria like PRJ*.C??  or *.B* to specify a much finer filtering of
    the resultant list.

  * New Keyboard Primitive commands:
      TxtHome       - Moves cursor to 1st visible data column of the current
                      line.  Like Home in a conventional editor.

      TxtNewLine    - Like NewLine, but moves cursor to the 1st visible data
                      column of the next line rather than the line number area.

      LineNo        - Moves the cursor to the line number area of the current
                      line.

      LastTab       - Tabs to the last (rightmost) tab marker.

      EndOfText     - Moves cursor to 1 past last non-blank on the line, unlike
                      EndOfLine which moves the cursor to 1 past the last
                      character on the line, blank or non-blank.

      LowerCase     - Will lower-case selected text on the screen.

      UpperCase     - Will upper-case selected text on the screen.

      TitleCase     - Will title-case selected text on the screen.

      SentenceCase  - Will sentence-case selected text on the screen.

      CutPaste      - Will act like Copy if text is selected, and if no text is
                      selected will act like Paste.

      Date          - Will Paste, at the current cursor location, the current
                      Date in your normal Windows Short format.

      Time          - Will Paste, at the current cursor location, the current
                      Time in the format hh:mm:ss AM. (12 hr format with
                      trailing AM/PM indication.

      ClipDate      - Will insert the current date, in normal Windows short
                      format, into the Clipboard.

      ClipTime      - Will insert the current time into the Clipboard in the
                      format hh:mm:ss AM (12 hr format with trailing AM/PM
                      indication).

      IsoDate       - Will Paste, at the current cursor location, the current
                      Date in ISO format YYYY-MM-DDD.

      IsoTime       - Will Paste, at the current cursor location, the current
                      Time in the format hh:mm:ss (24 hr format without AM/PM).

      ClipIsoDate   - Will insert the current date, in ISO format, into the
                      Clipboard.

      ClipIsoTime   - Will insert the current time into the Clipboard in the
                      format hh:mm:ss (24 hr format without AM/PM).

      ClipPath      - Will insert into the Clipboard the full path and
                      filename of the currently edited file.

      ClipName      - Will insert into the Clipboard the filename of the
                      currently edited file.

      SetInsert     - Will turn Insert mode ON regardless of its current
                      setting.

      ResetInsert   - Will turn Insert mode OFF regardles of its current
                      setting.

  * New key-mapping capabilities for labels and tags.  To define a key to set a
    label or tag, {.label} and {:tag} are used.  To define a key to clear a
    label or tag, {.} and {:} are used.  To define a key to toggle a label or
    tag, {..label} and {::tag} are used.

  * New line command H/HH ("Here"), which can be used as a destination for the
    line copy (C/CC) and move (M/MM) commands in much the same manner as A/B
    line commands are used.  The lines marked by H/HH will be REPLACED by the
    copied or moved lines; the lines originally marked with H/HH are deleted.

  * Two new line commands U/UU ("Use") and T/TT ("Take") may be used to specify
    line range operands to many of the Primary commands (CHANGE, CREATE, CUT,
    etc.) When a valid range has been marked with these commands, affected
    Primary commands will react as if a line range had been specified as part of
    the command itself.

    These new line commands effectively replace the use of the C/CC and M/MM
    line commands when used in conjunction with Primary commands, which now use
    U/UU in place of C/CC and use T/TT in place of M/MM commands.

    The existing C/CC and M/MM are now used exclusively to copy and move lines
    around in the edit file, and are not referenced any more by primary
    commands.

  * The Primary command line area will now scroll left/right as needed so that
    commands of any length can be entered.  Previously, if commands like FIND
    and CHANGE were entered with long text literals, it was very easy to 'run
    out of room' to enter the desired command.

  * Support for the 'K' line command modifier ("Keep").  When added to a line
    command, the command will be retained following the normal line operation.
    For example if a CK is entered on a line, and A on another, then after the
    copy of the line from the CK line to following the A line, the CK line
    command will remain in the line-command area.  All that is needed is another
    A command to repeat the Copy.  Unlike ISPF's implementation, 'kept' line
    commands are only removed by specifically blanking them, or via a RESET
    COMMAND primary command.

  * Support for two new line command modifiers, '+' and '-'.  When added to a
    line command, it requests that the lines, following the specified line
    operation, be Excluded ('-') or UnExcluded ('+') from the display.  For
    example, copying lines using a CC- /  CC pair to mark the source lines,
    will perform the Copy and then hide the lines marked by the CC commands
    as if the lines were marked with XX line commands as well.  If a CC+/CC
    pair were to be used, any excluded lines within the CC+/CC block will be
    unexcluded upon conclusion of the copy command.  When + or - is added to an
    A or B line command, the A or B itself is not changed, but the target lines
    themselves that are moved or copied After or Before that point are
    excluded (-) or unexcluded (+) as the move or copy takes place.

  * A new primary command TAG and associated enhancements to other commands now
    provide a powerful tool to locate and mark (i.e.  TAG) lines.  These
    'tagged' lines, whether contiguous or not, can now be isolated for
    processing by other commands.  Thus you are able to apply multiple criteria
    to select the lines to be processed.  For example, the following commands:

         TAG :AB ALL 'AB' 10
         CHANGE 'ONE' 'TWO' ALL :AB

    would first Tag all lines which have AB in column 10 with the Tag :AB, and
    then would change ONE to TWO on ONLY those lines previously tagged with :AB.

    Tags can be set 'en masse' via the TAG command, or manually by entering
    a Tag in the line number field. A Tag is a : followed by up to 5 characters.
    A tag is much like a line label (.HERE), except the same Tag can appear on
    any number of lines.

  * A special 'generic' tag of :ZALL can be used to reference every line having
    a line tag of any kind whatsoever regardless of tag name.  Similarly, a tag
    of :\ZALL can be used to reference every line NOT having a line tag.  :ZALL
    and :\ZALL are useful on commands such as FIND, CHANGE and EXCLUDE.

  * A label and a tag may co-exist on the same line (the label and tag are said
    to be "co-located").  When this condition exists, only the label will be
    visible in the sequence area of the affected line.  When the cursor is
    placed anywhere on the affected line, the tag name will appear below on the
    status line.  Additionally, for such lines, the blank column that normally
    appears between the sequence number field and column 1 of the data line will
    contain a : colon as a visible reminder that this line, which has a visible
    label, also has an undisplayed tag name.  If the label for this line is
    removed (in the usual way) the undisplayed tag will reappear in the sequence
    area.

  * The primitive keyboard command "(Delete)" will now delete a currently
    highlighted block of text on the screen.  This works for highlighted blocks
    having single lines and for multi-line blocks.

  * For consistency, the CUT command will now accept a REPLACE keyword even
    though this is the default if APPEND is not coded.  In addition, CUT will
    now accept the X and NX selection criteria to be used along with normal line
    range selection.

  * The CREATE and REPLACE commands may now optionally use the full range of
    line range commands, tag selection and X / NX selection when specifying
    the lines to be included.

  * The SORT command may now optionally use the full range of line range
    commands, tag selection and X / NX selection when specifying the lines to be
    included.   This means that scattered lines may be sorted independently of
    the intervening lines.  (For SORT X to operate the same as mainframe ISPF,
    it must be specified in SPFLite as SORT X DX to keep sorted lines excluded.)

    Also, new codes may be added to explicitly request a case sensitive sort (C)
    or a case insensitive sort (T).  These C or T codes may stand alone to apply
    to the entire sort, or may be combined with A or D to control individual
    sort fields.  The default for SORT's case sensitivity is the same as the
    current profile setting for the CASE option, which is also C or T.  (Note
    that the current CASE setting also appears as the letter C or T on the
    status line.)

    Former uses of Tritus SPF will notice these features and options are
    essentially the same as the Tritus SPF implementation of SORT.

  * Two new primary commands NFIND/NF and NEXCLUDE/NX.  These are effectively
    the negative versions of FIND/F and EXCLUDE/X, that is, they perform
    the 'NOT found' version of the tests that normal FIND/EXCLUDE do.  For
    example,  NFIND 'ABC' 10 will locate the 1st line that DOES NOT HAVE
    the characters ABC in column 10.   NEXCLUDE ALL 'ABC' 10 would exclude
    all lines which DO NOT HAVE the characters ABC in column 10.  In particular,
    starting from a file with no lines excluded, the command NX 'ABC' ALL will
    result in only lines containing 'ABC' still displayed. (Some editors refer
    to this capability as an ONLY function.)

  * Two new primary commands SHOW and NSHOW.  SHOW directly corresponds to
    EXCLUDE (X) with the same syntax, and NSHOW directly corresponds to NEXCLUDE
    (NX) with the same syntax.  Whereas EXCLUDE/NEXCLUDE only consider
    non-excluded lines (and based on some criteria, select lines to become
    excluded), SHOW/NSHOW only consider excluded lines, and based on some
    criteria, select lines to become un-excluded.

  * Many of the commands which support line range operands (CHANGE, CREATE,
    DELETE, EXCLUDE, FIND, FLIP, LC, NEXCLUDE, NFIND, RESET, SC, SORT, TAG, TC,
    UC) will now also support two new operands DX and MX.  These are used to
    override the normal action of line searching where a located line, if in
    excluded (X'd) state, will be unexcluded.

    The DX option (don't change exclusion) will leave the excluded status
    unchanged.  That means, previously excluded lines will remain excluded, and
    previously unexcluded lines will remain unexcluded.

    The MX option (make excluded) will force the line into excluded status,
    regardless of what its prior exclusion status was (excluded or not
    excluded).

    MX and DX should not be confused with X or NX.  X or NX on a command is used
    to decide which lines should be used or acted upon, based on their current
    exclusion status.  MX and DX control what the exclusion status of those
    lines is to be set to, after the command in question is completed.  The
    distinction is important to understand, because X or NX can be combined with
    MX or DX on the same command.  Example:  To change all occurrences of 'ABC'
    to 'DEF' on excluded lines, and then leave them excluded, can be done by the
    command: CHANGE 'ABC' 'DEF' ALL X DX

  * Two new line command modifiers which apply to some specific line range
    commands: (C, D, LC, M, O, S, SC, T, TC, UC, X, H, U).  These new
    modifiers / and \ are used to represent a range of lines that extends from
    the entered line all the way to the top (\) or all the way to the bottom
    (/) of the file.  For example entering D/ as a line command means "Delete
    all lines from here to the bottom".

    The / modifier may be thought of as a shortcut to typing '9' many times to
    mean 'all the lines from this point forward' like a line command of D99999.
    Instead of typing all those 9's you can just say D/ to do the same thing.
    The \ is basically the same idea, but it works in the opposite direction.

  * The LOCATE command has now been enhanced greatly to not only locate
    specific line numbers or labels, but can now be used to generically search
    for lines in various conditions. e.g. LOCATE NEXT LABEL will find the next
    line containing any label.  LOCATE CHANGE will find lines flagged by the
    ==CHG> line marker.  Other options are EXCLUDED, TAG, SPECIAL, KEEP, LONG,
    and COMMAND.  The FIRST, LAST, NEXT and PREV keywords are also supported.
    LOCATE LONG is used to find lines longer than the specified LRECL length.

  * A new Picture-like string called a Format is now supported.  Format strings
    use a type code of F instead of P.  Format strings differ from Pictures in
    that the codes other than those used for copying string characters (=, < and
    >) are not associated with positions in the source text.  This makes it
    possible to use F strings to "insert" and "format" values in ways
    traditional P strings cannot do.

  * New features with Picture and Format strings: The ~ tilde code may be used
    to skip over, or "delete" corresponding positions from the source string; a
    change Picture or a Format need not be the same length as the search string;
    the use of search picture codes like $ and @ in change pictures has been
    relaxed; these codes are now permitted (whereas in ISPF, these codes cannot
    be used in change pictures even though they otherwise have no special
    meaning).

  * A new command CASE, which takes an operand of C or T.  CASE is a PROFILE
    setting and is associated with the file type.  CASE controls how a search
    string is treated in FIND, CHANGE and similar commands, and is used when a
    string is not enclosed in quotes, or if a string is enclosed in quotes but
    does not contain a type code like C or T.  CASE does not affect letters that
    are within R strings, and does not apply to X strings, but does apply to P
    and F strings.

    For CASE C, the case of letters is treated "as is" or case-sensitive; for
    CASE T, the case of of letters is treated as case-insensitive.  The current
    state of the CASE option is shown on the status line as a C or T.

    The current CASE setting is respected by the SORT command.  As well, when
    Picture or Format search strings (with string types of P or F) contain
    letters, the matching process for these letters respects the CASE C or
    CASE T mode in effect at the time.

    When search strings contain explicit C or T string types, the C or T search
    string and its case-sensitivity is honored as in traditional ISPF, and the
    CASE mode in effect at the time is disregarded for such strings.

    In conjunction with this change, SPFLite fully supports and respects search
    strings of both types C and T, which it did not do previously.

  * Case-conformant text changes may be achieved by using a string of T'xxx' as
    a change-string value.  The character casing of the result string will
    conform to the casing of the source string, which is determined on a string
    by string basis.  When a case-conformant change string is longer than the
    search string, the upper or lower casing of the 'tail end' of the result is
    determined by 'propagating' the case of the last letter of the search
    string.  For example, CHANGE T'one' T'two' will change 'one' to 'two', 'One'
    to 'Two' and 'ONE' to 'TWO'.  CHANGE T'ONE' T'FOUR' will change 'One' to
    'Four' because the casing of lower-case 'e' in the third position of 'One'
    becomes propagated to the fourth position of T'FOUR' to become 'r'.

  * A new "show" line/block command S/SS is used to un-exclude a range of lines,
    regardless of the prior exclusion status of a block.  If the S line command
    is placed on an excluded line range, that entire excluded range becomes
    un-excluded.  This is a new use for the S line command, and the legacy ISPF
    S line command has been renamed to SI (Show Indentation).  The S/SS line
    commands may be thought of as the opposite of existing line commands X/XX.

  * KEEP and DROP primary commands may be used to selectively delete certain
    lines when groups of two or more adjacent lines have the same line tag.

  * A relative line label uses a defined line label to define a region of lines
    with respect to that label.  The following describes all allowable forms of
    relative line labels:

    .ABC                             the line .ABC

    .\ABC or .<>ABC or .¬ABC         all lines other than line .ABC

    .>ABC                            all lines after line .ABC

    .>=ABC                           the line .ABC and all lines after it

    .<ABC                            all lines before line .ABC

    .<=ABC                           the line .ABC and all lines before it

  * The PRINT command can now be run with a single operand (SETUP).  This will
    allow you to select a default printer for SPFLite output other than the
    Windows default printer.  Following the choice of printer, you will then
    be presented with a Font selection dialog to choose what Font, Pitch and
    Style (Bold, Italic, etc.) you prefer.

    The values chosen, along with the printer Duplex setting (if the printer
    supports Duplex) will be saved as your standard PRINT command settings.

  * The Join line command (J) has been extended from a single line join only, to
    a multi-line command.   Multiple lines may be joined either by appending a
    number to the J (like J5) or by using the standard JJ/JJ block command
    notation.  As well, a companion command has been created called Glue
    (G/GG).  The operation of Join and Glue are almost identical.  Join connects
    the data with one intervening blank character between the data from each
    line, while Glue joins lines together with no intervening blanks between
    them.

  * New primary commands RLOC and RLOCFIND.  RLOC will repeat the last generic
    LOCATE command.  For example, if the last generic locate was LOCATE CHG
    NEXT, then RLOC will continue to locate changed lines.  The RLOCFIND
    combines the capabilities of the new RLOC command with the traditional ISPF
    command RFIND, in order to repeat the last FIND or LOCATE command, whichever
    was issued most recently.  This makes RLOCFIND useful enough that many users
    may wish to set RLOCFIND as the command mapped to the F5 key rather than
    RFIND.

  * New line commands to trim, pad and truncate lines:

    Commands TR/TRR/TRTR ("Trim") are used to trim trailing blanks from one or
    more lines.  Their sole purpose is to selectively trim trailing blanks; no
    other data changes take place.

    Commands PL/PLL/PLPL ("Pad to Length") are used to force one or more lines
    to have an explicit minimum length.  Their sole purpose is to selectively
    add trailing blanks; no other data changes take place.

    Commands TL/TLL/TLTL ("Truncate to Length") are used to force one or more
    lines to have an explicit fixed length.  This action may involve deletion of
    non-blank data characters from the right-hand side of selected lines.

  * The representation of excluded lines is now shown in a new simplified design
    appearing as:  ------ ----------------------- < 001234 > ------.  This is a
    'fixed format' layout which is easier to find and read, especially when a
    file contains many interspersed instances of excluded and non-excluded
    lines.

  * File Manager will 'remember' the displayed list's position properly so
    that returning to the FM screen will not lose positioning.

  * The HELP command will now accept an operand to allow opening the Help file
    directly at a specified primary or line command. e.g. HELP EXCLUDE.

  * The DELETE primary command has a new, relaxed syntax that accepts the
    keyword ALL but treats it as optional and assumed.  This makes the DELETE
    syntax compatible with many different SPF-type editor programs.  In
    addition, unlike ISPF, the command DELETE ALL is now allowed in SPFLite as a
    legal command and will delete the entire edit file, and thus must be used
    with care.


Between 4.4.7 and 4.4.9
=======================

 * The 4.4.8 and 4.4.9 releases were entirely bug fixes, no new features.

Between 4.4.6 and 4.4.7
=======================

 * Correct intermittent crashes when ENDing an Edit. 
 * Correct character case testing in the Picture literals to correctly handle 
   the additional characters in the European languages.  
 * Correct display handling of long path names in File Manager when screen 
   width is very narrow.  
 * Correct handling of Newline key when display is in Hex mode.  

Between 4.4.5 and 4.4.6
=======================

 * Use different Installer / packaging to prevent false AV warnings.
 * Correct error in CLIP mode not autosaving to Clipboard at END.

Between 4.4.4 and 4.4.5
=======================

 * Correct error in CANCEL of a newly created file.
 * Correct error in calculating visible top/bottom of display screen.  This 
   could affect positioning performed by Find/RFind/Change/RChange processing.  


Between 4.4.3 and 4.4.4
=======================

 * Correct bug in Find/Change using the WORD option.


Between 4.4.2 and 4.4.3
=======================

 * Correct minor bug in marking textvia the keyboard.


Between 4.4.1 and 4.4.2
=======================

 Enhancements / New Features
 ===========================

  * The SPFLite screen can now be re-sized by normal stretching operations, in 
    addition to specifying the width and height in the Preferences - Screen 
    setting.  Altering the Font selection or Font size is still done in the 
    Preferences settings.  

  * Add monitoring of files while they are being Edited/Browsed for changes by 
    other applications in the system.  When modifications are detected, you 
    will be given the option to reload the modified data and replace the text 
    currently in the edit buffer.  

  * Add Column Marking.  This option is similar to TABS.  It will provide a 
    slim vertical line on the screen at specified column locations to assist in 
    aligning columnar data.  The columns specified are independent of TABS 
    columns; they may be the same, or different.  The color of the vertical 
    line is specified in the Preferences - Screen tab.  The column marking is 
    retained between sessions, and may be different for each file type.   The 
    new MARK line command is otherwise handled just like the TABS line 
    command.  

  * FIND, EXCLUDE and the 1st operand of CHANGE may now use Regular Expression 
    format for the search.  This is similar to the Use of the Picture literal 
    (e.g.  P'==##==') for those users who are familiar with and comfortable 
    using Regular Expressions.   The operand is coded, like the Picture literal 
    except the leading literal type character is 'R'.   For example to find the 
    letters ABC at the end of a line code R'ABC$'.  Full details of the Regular 
    Expression syntax will be in the Help file.  

  * Expand key mapping again to add the Ctl and Alt combinations with the 
    numeric (0-9) and special character keys (`-=[];'\,./).  As well, allow Ctl 
    and Alt keys to be mapped as individual keys and still be used in 
    combination with other keys.  

  * Prevent Numlock key from altering the overall system Numlock status.  

  * Add Numlock support.  The keypad may now be mapped as before for use as 
    Function keys, etc.  and will function this way when NumLock is OFF.   When 
    NumLock is ON (i.e.  LED is lit) the keypad will function as a normal 
    numeric keypad.   Since the NumLock key is mappable, toggling between 
    NumLock ON and NumLock OFF must be done with the Shift-Numlock 
    combination.  

  * Display column numbers in status line when cursor is on TABS, BNDS or MARK 
    lines.  

  * Add TOP and BOTTOM/BOT scroll commands.

  * BNDS added to the settings maintained by file type, like TABS, CAPS, DLMS 
    and MARK.  

  * If OPEN creates an Empty file because the file did not exist, and is still 
    empty when an END command is entered, you will be prompted as to whether 
    you really wish to save the empty file or delete it.  

  * Prevent DLMS line command from removing the blank as a delimiter.  If 
    DLMS=> line is completely blanked/erased, then the default set of DLMS 
    characters will be recreated.  

  * Line range operands  (.aa, .bb, etc.) support has been added to the 
    following commands: 

     FIND, CHANGE, RESET, SORT, and EXCLUDE

  * Alter text select to use inverse video of the selection area rather than a 
    simple line box around the selection.  

  * Some New 'primitive' key functions are now available, these are all to 
    provide a more familiar Windows style Cut / Paste operation ability: 

      Users who are running a 4.4.0 or 4.4.1 release will have to manually use 
      Preferences - Keymap to activate these new keys.  

      'MRKx' four companion commands MRKU, MRKD, MRKL and MRKR (Up, Down, Left 
             and Right) to support marking (MRK) of text via the keyboard in 
             the same manner as text can be selected with the mouse.  

             The keyboard text selection will support selecting areas larger 
             than a visible screen as well as stretching/shrinking of the 
             selected area.  Mouse support for selection is still restricted to 
             a single screen.  

             For new SPFLite installs, these will be defaulted to the Shift-Up, 
             Down, Left and Right arrow keys.  

      'KCPY' new keyboard function to separate the Cut of marked text on the 
             screen from the classic ISPF CUT command which is related to whole 
             text lines selected with CC/MM line commands.  It functions like 
             the normal Windows Ctl-C keyboard command.  

             For new SPFLite installs, this will be defaulted to the Ctl-C key.

      'KPAS' which is a new keyboard level paste command, different from both 
             the Primary PASTE and BPAS (below) commands.  KPAS will allow 
             pasting from the Clipboard into the middle of text lines, as well 
             as pasting into the Primary command line.  The function will honor 
             the INS/OVR status to either Insert the text (shifting existing 
             data right) or Overtype the existing data.  If more than one line 
             exists in the clipboard, only the 1st line will be used.  

             For new SPFLite installs, this will be defaulted to the Ctl-V key.

      'BPAS' (Block Paste) this is the previous BPASTE primary command which 
             has moved to become a keyboard function for compatability with the 
             other cut / paste functions.  

             BPAS will also now position the cursor following the last 
             character of the pasted data.  

             For new SPFLite installs, this will be defaulted to the Alt-V key.

 Maintenance / Bug Fixes
 =======================

  * Correct handling of the NewLine key when below the last line.

  * Correct positioning following Paste / Overlay.

  * Correct an error which caused the Back-Tab function to 'disappear'.

  * Reset ==CHG> indication on any activity in the line number field as well as 
    text field.  

  * For clarity, add spacer pixels between text margins and screen border.

  * Add missing aliases for the line commands TAB, BND and DLM.

  * Add aliases .ZF and .ZL for .ZFIRST and .ZLAST.

  * Correct Move --> Overlay to work like SPF itself regarding equal characters 
    in the two lines.  

  * A mouse click to position the cursor on the command line will automatically 
    move the cursor to the left margin if the command field is blank.  

  * UNDO now properly restores the modified data indicator along with the data.

Between 4.4.0 and 4.4.1
=====================

  * Correct nasty startup bug in 4.4.0


Between 4.3.2 and 4.4.0
=====================

  Enhancements
  ____________

  * Add additional overall command and operand aliases to match real SPF usage.

  * Extend PFKeys from 36 to 48 by allowing the Alt-Fx combination to be used.  
    i.e.  there are now unaltered, Shift, Control and Alt versions of the F1 
    thru F12 keys.  

  * Extend key mapping to include Alt-A to Alt-Z, as well as Ctl/Shift/Alt 
    combinations with the following keys:  Backspace, Delete, Down, End, Enter, 
    Home, Insert, Left, PgDown, PgUp, Right, and Up.  This should considerably 
    assist when using Laptop type keyboards.  

  * The "Re-Open last file at Start" option of the Preferences - General tab 
    has been enhanced so that SPFLite will re-open the SET of files that were 
    being edited when SPFLite last terminated.  Note this works properly only 
    when SPFLite is terminated using the Close Button (X) on the Title bar, not 
    if tabs are closed individually.  

  * Alter the 'Modified' indicator.  A modified file will now be indicated by 
    the characters (M) in front of the filename on the Tab header.  This will 
    allow the modified status of all open tabs to be seen at once as well as on 
    BROWSE and CLIP tabs which previously did not show Modified status.  

  * Enhance File Manager operation to properly monitor for changes in the 
    currently displayed directory regardless of where or how altered.  

  * Allow user control of the delimiters used to determine WORD, PREFIX and 
    SUFFIX searches by the FIND and CHANGE commands.  This will allow proper 
    support for programming languages which allow special characters to be part 
    of variable names.  e.g.  characters like _ .  - etc.  

    A new line command DLMS (Delimiters) will display the current set of 
    delimiter characters and you may alter these as desired.  Like the TABS 
    line data, the values set for DLMS are retained uniquely by file type.   
    i.e.  You may have separate delimiter sets for TXT files, CPP files, CMD 
    files etc.  

  * Add new line command 'N' - New line.   This is just like the 'I' - Insert 
    command except the lines inserted are permanent and will remain as blank 
    lines even if unused.  

  * Add a new Primary command - SAVEAS.  This saves the current text as a new 
    file and immediately swaps the current tab to using the new filename as the 
    defalt filename.  Just like the comparable Windows file system Save As 
    does.  

  * Enhance PASTE command.  As well as specifying an A/B to indicate where to 
    insert the data, you may now use the O / OO (Overlay) line commands to 
    request the Clipboard data be overlaid onto existing text lines rather than 
    simply inserted.  

  * Enhance cursor mode (INS/OVR) handling to keep modes in multiple tabs 
    unique.  

  * The CAN/CANCEL command will close the current tab if File Manager is active 
    and switch to the File Manager screen.  If File Manager is not active, it 
    will simply 'throw away' the current edit and remain on the current tab.  

  * Support Print Screen key (and its Shift, Ctl, and Alt versions).  This will 
    provide 4 variations of capturing the current screen: 
      PrtScr       - Captures the entire SPFLite screen to the clipboard in 
                     Text mode.  

      Ctl-PrtScr   - Captures only the text area of the screen to the clipboard 
                     in Text mode.  

      Shft-PrtScr  - Prints the entire SPFLite screen to the Default Printer.  

      Alt-PrtScr   - Captures the entire screen to a LOG filein Append mode.

    Note: If you wish a normal Windows Screen Print it should be done when 
          SPFLite does NOT have the keyboard focus, for obvious reasons.  

  Bug fixes / Maintenance
  _______________________

  * Conversion of Help file to different Help Authoring tool.  I would 
    appreciate it if any 'oops' in the conversion could be reported.  Mostly 
    they will be in the Internal Topic Links which had to be manually 
    converted.  

  * Correct Insert line cleanup following an UNDO command.   Remove '''''' line 
    markers earlier in processing to indicate sooner that they are real lines.  

  * Correct parsing of Scroll amount field to better match the real SPF 
    parsing.  

  * Simplify format of the Status line.

  * Correct cursor positioning when Left/Right scrolling with fixed amounts 
    (PAGE/HALF/etc.) 

  * Correct minor errors in Up/Down commands for differing scroll amounts and 
    RULER status.  

  * Correct missing error messages when error occurs during new tab creation.  

  * Correct RETRIEVE recall when doing repeated recalls of the same command.  

  * Correct parse error in SORT command when optional operands were omitted.  

Between 4.3.1 and 4.3.2
=====================

  * Add error message when invalid Colorize control file statement detected.  

  * Fix Duh!  error.  An = sign was not being considered a delimiter when 
    FIND/CHANGE were searching for WORD operands.  

  * Correct some errors related to switching in and out of HEX mode.

  * Correct missing function keys in Preferences key mapping.  Sort Real-Key 
    selection list.  

  * Allow mouse selection of blocks of text from the screen (i.e.  not 
    necessarily entire lines.) When a CUT command is issued with a selected 
    text block present, then ONLY that selected block is copied.  

  * A new command BPASTE (Block Paste) will perform an overlay type block paste 
    where the current cursor location is the upper-left corner of the paste 
    area.  Any existing text is overlaid, lines will be lengthened as needed 
    and additional lines added if the paste block extends past the last line.  

  * Improvements to the loading speed for text files, particularly large ones, 
    and add a visual progress indicator of activity during loading or saving of 
    large files.  

  * Allow key mapping of the Ctl-A thru Ctl-Z keys.  Activate via the KeyMap 
    tab of Preferences.  The default is as in previous versions (NOT to map) 
    and to pass Ctl keys through as normal text characters.  This will aid 
    SPFLite on laptop keyboards where it is easy to 'run out' of map'able 
    keys.  As well, mapping (for example) Ctl-C and Ctl-V to PFKeys set to CUT 
    and BPASTE will allow cut/paste operations using familiar Windows 
    short-cuts.  

Between 4.3.0 and 4.3.1
=====================

  * Correct error in assigning default directories.

Between 4.2b and 4.3.0
=====================

  * Alter default mapping for the KeyPad Ins/Del keys to actually BE Ins/Del.

  * Several cosmetic changes related to cursor positioning after some commands 
    to more closely match the real ISPF actions.  

  * Correct certain cursor positioning when movement passes through Excluded 
    lines.  

  * When using File Manager, a mouse Left-Click may now be used on any of the 
    detail line items displayed to simulate the entry of an "S" (Select) + 
    <Enter> for that line.  This provides an alternate and usually quicker 
    method of navigation when moving up/down/through file directories.  

  * New option for the naming of BKP files.  Previously the .BKP level was 
    always added to the end of the Edit filename (e.g.  Test.txt backup would 
    be Test.txt.BKP).  This caused the filetype of all backup files to be the 
    same and also incorrectly reflect the type of file.  A new Preferences 
    option may be selected to have the .BKP level INSERTED before the file 
    type.  (e.g Test.txt backup would be Test.BKP.txt) 

  * Add support for basic handling of UniCode encoded files.  The support 
    provides for translation on Input and for re-translation to the same 
    encoding format on output.  While editing, only normal ANSI character 
    handling is performed based on your current default codepage.  Encoding 
    support is provided for UTF-8 and UTF-16 (both Big-Endian and 
    Little-Endian).  See the new ENCODING command as well as a new Help section 
    "Handling Unicode Files" 

  * Alter handling of filenames and default directories.  It had become rather 
    inconsistent since the introduction of the File Manager option.  

    Now, when no operand at all or only a simple unqualified filename is 
    provided for the CREATE, REPLACE, OPEN or EDIT commands, the default 
    directory used for writing the file or for the file open dialog's starting 
    directory will be determined as follows: 

    -- If there is an active file being edited in the tab where the command is 
       issued, then the Path for THAT Active file is used as the default for 
       the command.  

    -- If there is NO active file (i.e. the tab header displays (Empty):

       -- If File Manager is active, the current displayed directory of File 
          Manager will be used.  

       -- If File Manager is NOT active, then the Preferences setting for 
          Default Open directory will be used (Last Used or Working).  Remember 
          'Working' means the Windows working directory when SPFLite was 
          started.  

  * As well as the above, file names passed on the command line to SPFLite when 
    starting, will always use the Working Directory as the default location 
    unless the passed filename is a complete full pathname (which will of 
    course be used).  



Between 4.2a and 4.2b
=====================

  * Adjust TS line command to keep indent of split lines the same.

  * Correct calculation of mouse click cursor location when adjacent to window 
    border.  

  * Correct Profile Preferences dialog.  The Mouse and Key Mapping pull-down 
    lists for 3270 keys were missing the UP, RIGHT and TAB settings.  

Between 4.2 and 4.2a
====================

Bug Fixes
---------

  * Correct Colorise parsing error introduced by the new ESCAPECHR support.

  * Correct cursor positioning in File Manager when switching to directories
    with fewer display items than the previous directory.

  * Correct corrupted Help and PDF Documentation files.

Between 4.1c and 4.2
========================

Enhancements
------------

  * Introduce an optional integrated File Manager to assist in managing and 
    selecting files for Edit or Browse, and for basic File Delete & Rename 
    functions.  This support can be activated via an option on the Preferences 
    - General Tab.  

  * Improve Colorize support: 
      > New MIXEDCASE YES/NO option to Colorize files to support languages 
        which are sensitive to the case of keywords.  (e.g.  Java) 
      > New ESCAPECHR x option to allow specification of an ESC character 
        sequence for those languages that use this.   e.g.  With ESCAPECHR \ 
        the following would be a valid literal.  
                                        'What\'s the answer'

  * Add two new text support line commands:
      SC / SCSC - Sentence case.  Convert the text to sentence format.  All 
                  words are first lower-cased, then the first word of each 
                  'sentence' is capitalized.  
      TC / TCTC - Title case.  Convert the text to Title format.  All words are 
                  first lower-cased, then the first letter of each word is 
                  capitalized.  

  * Reinstate the Scroll amount field on the SPFLite screen to allow setting a 
    different default scroll amount from the previous CSR only default.  Add 
    another Preferences value to control the default starting value for the 
    field.  If not altered, the default will be CSR as in previous versions.  

  * An optional Label is now available for PFK definitions.  If used the label 
    will be displayed by the PFSHOW line(s) rather than the actual command and 
    its parameters.  To enter a Label, simply prefix the actual command with 
    the label enclosed in square brackets.  
        e.g.    [Test Data]Can;OPEN "D:\Public\Data\Test Data.txt"    assigned to PFK5
    would display in the PFSHOW line as 05=Test Data
                            rather than 05="Can;OPEN D:\Pu...

  * Implement the CRETRIEV primary command.

  * Add a visible "Changed" indicator to show a file has been altered since 
    Open / Last Save.  

  * Add X and NX operands to PRINT to allow printing of only excluded or 
    non-excluded lines.  

Bug Fixes
---------

  * Correct handling of Locate commands past the last line.  (e.g.  L 999999) 

  * Correct Find/RFind handling of 'Not found' and wrapping back to the top to 
    continue the search.  

  * Altered scanning of multiple mixed line commands to improve the 'sorting 
    out' of non-contiguous sets of commands.  e.g.  Copy/Move --> After groups 
    with interspersed Immediate commands (I / D type).  

  * Correct Preferences reporting a false error related to Key Mapping when no 
    change to Key Mapping had been performed.  

  * Correct OPEN processing when specifying a non-existent file from the Open 
    Dialog.  

  * Correct error in loading Colorize control files.

  * Revise RETRIEVE handling to more closely match the normal IBM ISPF 
    handling.  

  * Correct logical Screen position following a CANCEL command.

  * Correct parsing of stacked commands with embedded Cmd delimiters within 
    literals.  

  * Correct inadvertent altering of the Screen Height setting when PFK Show is 
    activated.  

  * Correct incorrect display of PF24 when PFSHOW is used.

  * Correct handling of Up/Down commands when cursor line is being deleted.  

  * Correct colorize keyword lookup, it was somewhat less than 100% accurate 
    before.  

  * Correct colorize parsing error related to the COMMENT2 delimiter.

  * Correct error in shutting down when AUTOSAVE is set to ON.

  * Correct intermittent 'phantom' cursor when switching tabs.

  * Correct error when opening a new file in a 'CANCELed' tab.


Between 4.1b and 4.1c
========================
* Correct internal remnants of one line command corrupting subsequent line 
  commands.  


Between 4.1a and 4.1b
========================
* Correct previous bug fix which caused pending line commands to be 
  overlooked.  


Between 4.1 and 4.1a
========================
* Correct CREATE / REPLACE treating MM line commands as CC commands.

* Keep current screen location following CREATE / REPLACE command completion.  

* Correct handling of default directory when multiple tabs open to different 
  directories.  


Between 4.0Beta2 and 4.1
========================
* Performance improvements for simple cursor movements.

* Correct handling of line number references on CREATE / REPLACE / CUT / PRINT 
  commands.  

* Change PAGE command name to SWAP (more logical and matches ISPF usage).  PAGE 
  will be kept internally as an alias for SWAP.  

* Correct handling of COPY and PASTE commands when other line commands, in 
  addition to the required A/B location specifier, are entered at the same 
  time.  

* Add additional aliases for LCLC/UCUC commands (LL/UU) and correct parsing 
  error on line commands which would allow numeric repeat factor on commands 
  which do not need/support it.  

* Internal changes to simplify code re: Windows common dialog prompts.

* Add new Line Command (J) - Join, which will join the specified line with the 
  next line.  

    e.g       J.....       Here's   some   text
              ......    Some more text
    would become the single line
              ......       Here's   some   text    Some more text

    Note multiple embedded spaces are not compressed (like the TF command) nor 
    are leading spaces removed from the lines.  

* SPFLite will now accept files via Drag/Drop onto the window to OPEN them (in 
  a new tab if the currently selected tab is not (Empty).  

* Correct handling of Background color setting when change is made from a tab 
  running with a colorize setting with a different BG color than that set in 
  the Preferences - Screen tab.  

* New PROFILE option to request all SPFLite edits be kept as tabs in a single 
  window.  e.g.  If turned ON, a file dropped on the SPFLite Icon, would simply 
  Open as an edit, in a new tab, in the existing SPFLite session.  A separate 
  window can always be created via the EDIT command in the currently active 
  window, which will always open a new independent window.  

* Ctl-LeftArrow and Ctl-Right arrow will now provide a 'quicker' way to move 
  the cursor left and right.  The cursor will be moved to the start of the 
  next/previous word on the line.  At the left/right end of the line, the 
  cursor will move to the appropriate word on the prev/next line.  

  These keys are only active on text lines, and 'word' is a simple blank 
  delimited string.  i.e.  multiple words within quotes (e.g.  a literal) are 
  NOT considered to be one word.  

  If you dislike compound key sequences, the functions can be re-assigned to 
  some other keys (like a PFK) with Profile Preferences - Key Map.   The keys 
  are named CTLF and CTRT.  


Between 4.0Beta1 and 4.0Beta2
=============================
* Correct default minimum size for Cursor size in Preferences - Screen to 20%.  
  Values lower than 20 may not even appear on certain Font / Screen 
  resolutions.  

* Correct Left/Right mouse click event handling (inadvertently crippled - 
  Oops).  


Between 3.2 and 4.0Beta1
========================
* The main enhancement in this release is the addition of a Tabbed interface.  
  You can now open multiple edits in the same window.  Each edit will appear in 
  its own Tab.  Short description of Tab handling: 
    > An OPEN command issued in an Edit session containing existing data will 
      open a new tab.  

    > An OPEN issued in an 'empty' tab (e.g.  from a prior CANCEL) will open in 
      the same tab.  

    > Switching tabs can be done via the mouse (clicking on the desired tab) or 
      via a new primary command PAGE Next/Prev.  The command would typically be 
      assigned to a PFK.  
    > An END command will close the active tab (saving if appropriate).  

    > A click on the Window Close button (X) will cause all tabs to close (with 
      saving as appropriate) 


* Correction to line number reset in Copy/Overlay handling.

* Correct recovery from illegal line commands on Top / Bottom of File lines.

* Correct RFIND start search location when cursor is not in the data area.

* Prevent program crash using X99999 line command on large files with multiple 
  large blocks already excluded.  

* Correct handling of CRLF setting in the Preferences General tab.

* LOCATE (L) command will now un-'X' the requested line if it is currently X'd 
  out' 

* Enhance FIND parsing to 1) Prevent mixed numeric/alpha operands being treated 
  as numeric 

                          2) Allow simple single numeric operands to be treated 
                             as literals 

                                e.g.    FIND 1234         will be treated as
                                        FIND "1234"

* Correction to FIND FIRST for incorrect starting column on 1st line.

* Reduce unneeded space in preferences dialog to reduce total height.

* New preference option for the Window Title.  The filename may be chosen to be 
  1st in the title line.  This means the text in the Windows Task bar will 
  properly identify which file is edited rather than always saying "SPFLite 
  (Vx.y).......  

* New Preference option to replace the Blob cursor setting.  You may now 
  control the height of the Normal and Insert cursors individually, each based 
  on a % height of a full Blob cursor.  The defaults are 20% for a normal 
  cursor, and 90% for an Insert cursor.  

* Correct handling of cursor positioning when Enter is pressed while the cursor 
  is in the Line number area.  

Between 3.2 and 3.1a
===================
* Performance improvements for scrolling of large text files.

* The code for handling of data entry in the line number area has been totally 
  replaced.  The 1st action in the line number area will now blank the whole 
  field to avoid possible incorrect line commands being formed by a blend of 
  typed characters and previous line number numerics.  This change also removes 
  the need for the 'Insert in Line number safely' option which has been 
  removed.  

* Support has been added for bookmarks (line labels).  Any character string 
  starting with a period may be entered in the line number area.  e.g.  .here, 
  .there, .back, etc.  Once entered you can reposition quickly to the 
  bookmarked location with the Locate command.  For example,entering L .here 
  would scroll the bookmarked .here line to the top of the screen.  

  As well, primary commands which can have line number operands will accept 
  either absolute line numbers or bookmark labels.  e.g.  PRINT NONUM .from .to 
  (assuming the .from and .to labels had previously been assigned).  Primary 
  commands affected are: CREATE, CUT, DELETE, LOCATE, PRINT and REPLACE.  

* Enhancements to the CUT command.
   * CUT command will will now ignore X'd lines which are included in the CUT 
     range.  This will allow CUT'ing of fragmented ranges of lines by excluding 
     the undesired embedded ranges.  
   * The CUT command will now accept an APPEND command (or any abbreviation of 
     it) to request the specified CUT range be ADDED to the current contents of 
     the clipboard.  e.g.  CUT 10 20 APP 

* Prevent internal commands appearing in the RETRIEVE stack.

* Correct cursor positioning after an 'S' line command on an Excluded range.

* Correct Preferences processing when invoked by a PFKEY command.

* Correct Preferences 3270 Key List (typo for PF34)

* Minor spelling errors corected.

* An EDIT filename, or OPEN filename command where the filename does not exist, 
  will continue and open the file as a new, empty text file rather than report 
  an error.  A CANCEL out of the edit will delete the newly created file (e.g.  
  it was a typo) 

* The HIDE command is now a 'toggle' type command (like HEX) to turn HIDE mode 
  on and off.  The HIDE operand of RESET has been removed.  

* The RESET command now supports the CHANGE, COMMAND, EXCLUDED, LABEL and 
  SPECIAL operands.  

* EOLN (Erase to end of field) now works in line number area.

* SPFLite previously always initialized using the last used directory as the 
  starting directory.  a new option now allows you to specify that it should 
  use the 'Working' directory as the default.  

* Format of the COLS and RULER line altered to match the format of IBM's ISPF.

Between 3.1a and 3.0b
===================
* Correct initialization code so -CLIP command option is handled properly.

* Correct Preferences handling of Insert Line Numbers Safely.

* Correct display of INI file name at the bottom of the Preferences Dialog so 
  that long path/filename combinations are not truncated.  

* Correct handling of Status Line after change in color preferences.

* Correct repaint of selected color choice in Preferences.

* Show effect of selected color in main window while choosing colors in 
  Preferences.  

* A filename specified as an operand when starting SPFLite will, if it does not 
  exist, cause an empty Null file to be created rather than report as a "File 
  not found" error.  If the edit is CANCELed before saving, the file will be 
  deleted.  

* An UP arrow while in the Command Line when Keyboard scrolling is active will 
  wrap to the last line of the screen rather than remain on the Command line.  

* The command line option -INIT will now accept a fully qualified filename.  If 
  this is provided in place of the 'simple' INI name then SPFLite will use the 
  noted filename, even if it is NOT in the normal INI path.  A 'simple' name 
  will still be searched for in the normal INI path.  

* The command retrieve stack, used by the RETRIEVE command, will now only save 
  unique values (it will not save the same command twice) and will also now 
  save the current stack between SPFLite sessions.  

* Add support to Picture literals for the '.' character (any non display 
  character).  The Preferences > General tab now also contains a setting to 
  allow specification of 'normal' characters.  This will allow customization of 
  'normal' to include national characters (Å, Ç etc.) and other special 
  characters (Euro €, Pound £, etc.) 

Between 3.0b and 3.0a
===================
* Remove PFK line insertion fix for review, it was seriously flawed.

* Correct handling color selection of Line Number area Hi/Lo.

* Correct Preferences handling of Screen Height when PFK Show is active.

* Correct Font selection when OK pressed with no font actually selected.

* Correct handling of Keyboard Scrolling selection (it was not being saved).

* Corrected logic in handling BKP file creation.

Between 3.0a and 2.16
===================
* Major change to the saving of Profile and Initialization settings.  
  Previously some were kept in the INI file, and some in the System Registry.  
  These settings have now been combined and will be kept in a new format INI 
  file.  The INI file is now in 'standard' INI file format.  

* Direct editing of the INI file is no longer needed (nor recommended).  All 
  INI settings are now alterable by a Tabbed Preferences dialog.  This is 
  reached via the PROFILE command.  

* The TRY command no longer exists, the preferences dialog now serves this 
  purpose.  

* The former PROFILE and PFKEY commands will both now invoke the Preferences 
  Dialog.  

* To better handle security in Vista (and later) systems, the INI file will no 
  longer be stored in the Install directory, but in the standard user documents 
  folder (e.g.  My Documents\SPFLite in XP, or Documents\SPFLite in Vista).  

* User macros (*.SPM files) and colorize files (*.CLR) files will also be 
  stored in the same data directory.  The initial execution of SPFLite V3.00 
  will handle copying these files to the new location.  

* Screen color customization can now select the full range of available colors, 
  not just the simple basic 16 'standard' colors.  

* CLR (Colorize control files) may also now use the full range of available 
  colors.  See the Help Appendix for the change to the SCHEME statement.  

* As much as possible, previous settings have been migrated automatically, 
  however it was not possible to handle them all.  The first execution of this 
  release will automatically place you into the Preferences Dialog.  Two main 
  areas not converted were the Keyboard Mapping, and the Screen color 
  settings.  As well TABS settings which were automatically saved for each 
  edited file type will not have been converted.  

* If SPFLite is copied to a removeable drive (e.g.  a USB thumbdrive) and 
  executed from the removeable drive, then the EXE file location will be used 
  to look for the INI, SPM and CLR files.  This will enable a properly 
  customized SPFLite to be used on systems to which it has never been 
  installed.  

* Correction to handling screen background color during colorize processing.

* Correction to handling of LEFTCLICK and RIGHTCLICK options when the CHRx 
option is selected.  

* Correction to UP command when cursor is in line number area of the last line 
  on the screen.  

* Correction to PFK insertion of line commands when the cursor is IN the Top Of 
  Data / Bottom of Data text area.

* Yet another tweak to line command parsing.

* Correct Find logic when search literal contains trailing blanks, or is all 
  blanks.  

* Some more optimizations using new compiler features.

Between 2.16 and 2.15
===================

* Correct handling of dead keys with International keyboard layouts.

* Add support to CLR files to point at a different (common) CLR file to use.  
  This will allow a single common CLR file to support multiple source file 
  types.  See Help file for more details.  

* Add Beep (if ERRORBEEP ON) when character key hit when in a non-typeable 
  area.  

* Finally (for the many requesting it) add HEX support.

* Add support for Hex literals as well.   e.g. x'3132'.

* Add PROFILE option (ROpenLast - Yes/No).  If YES, and no filename is provided 
  on the command line, SPFLite will re-Open the last file edited when 
  starting.  

Between 2.15 and 2.14
===================

* Correct nasty bug which, for larger files, would cause lines to be split in 
  two.  

Between 2.14 and 2.13
===================

* Correct FIND/CHANGE command parsing for handling bounds overrides when global 
  BOUNDS values are active.  

* Add new command line parameter to allow alternate INI files to be specified.  
  This will allow separate Startup Icons to be created for different screen 
  sizes, keyboard mappings, etc.  

* Due to previous item, parsing of the command line is slightly altered.  If 
  you currently use the CLIP or BROWSE options, a trivial format change to the 
  operands is required.  

* Correct LOCATE command positioning when used in stacked commands which also 
  move the cursor when non-data lines (X, BNDS, etc.) are present.  

* Correction to properly save PROFILE ERRORBEEP setting.

* Correction to CHANGE ALL X so that all occurrences on an X'd line are done, 
  not just the 1st.  

* Leave cursor position unchanged unless needed when processing PFK commands.  

* Alter file reading routine to always read to the true EOF.  Previously an 
  embedded Ctl-Z was treated as the end of file.  

* Add support for the Data Shift line commands:  << < > >> .

* Add new TRY command to allow testing new Screen Width / Height / and Font 
  selections.  

* Add new EDIT command to spawn additional SPFLite sessions.

* Give up on Windows MSI files for the installer. Way too picky; way too slow.

Between 2.13 and 2.12
===================

* Add NOFLUSH command for Batch files to prevent a command error stopping the 
  execution of following commands.  e.g.  a series of CHANGE commands where 
  some of the search values may not always be present.  

* Correction (further) to Line Command parsing.

* Enhance keyboard routine which did not support Shift and Ctl with the 
  Function keys to support additional function keys.  Note that this change has 
  altered the DEFAULT sample INI file.  If you have a customized INI file you 
  should review it to see if you might use this support.  
    Note also the default ENTER key is now Enter (not Right-Ctl) as this seemed 
    to cause a lot of confusion to new users before any customization was 
    performed.  

* Variety of cleanup in handling command line refreshing when command syntax 
  errors occur.  

* Corrections to keyboard handling of Numeric keys and Numlock combinations.  

* Corrections to Search commands when search literal has trailing blanks and 
  the searched for text occurs at end of line.  

* Correction to F and L line commands to properly adjust for subsequent line 
  commands.  

* Correction for CANCEL command not resetting Left/Right scroll.

* Correction for Line Insert not scrolling to inserted line.

* Correction for FIND/CHANGE ignoring cursor position if in the line number 
  area.  

* Add a few more aliases for primary commands.

* Add support for the S (Show) line command.

* Correction to tab handling when on Top/Bottom of Dataset lines.

* Correct window title of Help file.

Between 2.12 and 2.11
===================

* Correction to PFKEY command which ignored settings for PFK10.

* Addition to Colorize support to allow unique color for quoted literals.  See 
  the Appendix description of Colorize support for the new QUOTED keyword.  

* Correction to handling variable substitution in macros.

* Correct RUN command to invoke all commands IN the SPFLite install directory.

* Allow PFK definitions to stack Primary Commands after an initial Line 
  Command.  


Between 2.11 and 2.10
===================

* Enhance the RUN command to allow use of the variable substitution 
  characters.  (~f, ~p, etc.) 

* Addition of ~l/~L variable for the current line the cursor is on.

* Addition of Source Colorize support.  See new PROFILE COLORIZE option and 
  Appendix description of Colorize support and Keyword file layout.  

* Correction to CREATE and REPLACE commands when used with a new file to load 
  the appropriate TABS and Colorize defaults for the file extension.  

* Correction (again) to line command parsing.

* Correct error which caused the command line to sometimes appear to not be 
  recognized.  

* Correction to PASTE command to properly handle text data with non-standard 
  line delimiters.  i.e.  MAC or UNIX type line endings.  

Between 2.10 and 2.9
===================

* Correction to line command handling of MM/OO ranges where scrolling is needed 
  to enter the commands.  

* Correction in handling copied/moved BNDS or TABS lines.

* Correction to Change command handling of blank search string and column 
  oriented data.  

* Correction to handling of RETRIEVEd commands.

* Correction to Save Open file dialogue from forcing .txt extension.

* Correction to parsing of operands containing mixed single and double quotes.  

* Correction to search logic during backward searches (PREV operand).  

* Correction to search hi-lighting when line ultimately becomes Excluded.  

* Enhance search logic to treat short or null lines as space filled during 
  compares.  
   
* Blank lines in the INI file are now treated as comments.

* Addition of optional Beep for error messages.  See PROFILE ErrorBeep ON/OFF.  

* Addition of PROMPT as an option of PROF AUTOSAVE in addition to ON/OFF.  

* Addition of CAPS status to filetype data saving along with the TABS line.  

* Addition of support for a limited Macro ability.  Support for a simple file 
  of Primary commands with operand variable substitution.  

* Addition of a Font package on the SPFLite web site to supply some alternative 
  fixed pitch fonts for use with SPFLite.  

Between 2.9 and 2.8
===================

* Corrections so that Shortcuts dropped on the SPFLite icon will properly open 
  the file to which the shortcut points.  

* Correct error where the 'F' Line command prior to a Change command could 
  corrupt Data.  

* Correct error which could cause crashes at program termination under some 
  Windows versions.  

* Correct error in PRINT command handling of line ranges.  

* Improvements to File loading speed for larger files.  

* Update to finally add UNDO support.  

* Update to allow keyboard mapping to specify a actual character to substitute 
  as well as the normal 3278 control keys.  e.g.  make the keypad back into a 
  'normal' numeric keypad.  

* Update to support NONUM operand on PRINT command.

* Update to support a BROWSE mode to prevent accidental changing and saving of 
  data when using SPFLite to simply browse files.  

* Update to support optional Cursor Blink/Noblink

* Update to support an optional Status line on the bottom of the screen.  Line 
  will show status of: Insert, Caps, Screen cursor position, and logical data 
  cursor location.  

* Update to support optional display of PFK definitions at bottom of screen.

  Refer to new SET values in the INI file for:
      > CursorBlink option
      > StatLine ON/OFF
      > UNDO number of levels specification
      > Color definitions for the New Status and PFK Show lines
      > Sample use of new Leyboard mapping option (CHRx)

  Refer to the PROFILE command for PFK definition display (PROFILE PFKSHOW).

Between 2.8 and 2.7
===================

* Corrections to line command handling of ranges with Excluded lines.

* Corrections to restore the RETRIEVE command damaged by a fix in the 2.7 
  release.  

* Corrections for window Title bar contents following a CANCEL command.

* Updates to keyboard support.  SPFLite should now support alternate keyboard 
  layouts.  

Between 2.7 and 2.6
===================

* Corrections to scrolling when there are pending Line Commands.

* Several new customization options related to how Insert Mode is handled.
  There are four new PROFILE options:
    INSMODE      - ON/OFF - specifies whether to start in Insert mode or not - 
                            default OFF.  

    INSRESET     - ON/OFF - specifies whether to reset active Insert mode to 
                            the default INSMODE on an Attn key.  Default ON.  

    INSSAFELN    - ON/OFF - Specifies handling of Insert mode in the Line 
                            Number area.  Default is ON.  ON  - Insert chars 
                            only if trailing blanks exist in field OFF - Insert 
                            always, shift and truncate at right end as needed.  

    INSBLOBCUR   - ON/OFF - Specifies what cursor to use in Insert mode.  ON  - 
                            Use a 'blob' cursor.  OFF - Use a normal Underline 
                            cursor.  

Between 2.6 and 2.5
===================

* Correct Title Bar setup when SPFLite started with a filename on the command 
  line.  

* Corrected cursor positioning for FIND/CHANGE.  When CHANGE text contains the 
  FIND string, incorrect positioning caused SPFLite to 'loop' on the text line 
  till cancelled or memory was exhausted.  

* Correction to handling Repeat value on CC/MM line commands.

* Correct location of inserted BNDS line to be BEFORE the requesting line 
  rather than AFTER.  

* Correct RESET logic handling of 'special' lines (COLS, BNDS, etc.).

* Correct several problems when manipulating files with very large line 
  counts.  Note: SPFLite's memory management is NOT designed for very large 
  files (> 100,000 lines).  It will simply run slower and slower and become 
  basically unusable.  

Between 2.5 and 2.4
===================

* Implemented the Primary HIDE command and associated RESET HIDE.

* Corrected error handling when PASTE issued without an A/B line command.

* Corrected line command processing when multiple pending requests are 
  entered.  

* Numerous corrections to the handling of line commands involving XX'd out 
  lines.  The errors ranged from incorrect data handling to outright crashes.  

* Corrected error in handling MOVE/OVERLAY when fewer source lines than 
  destination lines.  

* Corrected error in Primary FLIP command.

Between 2.4 and 2.3
===================

* Corrected a long-undiscovered bug in handling Move/Overlay when the Overlay 
  lines are higher in the file than the Move lines.  

Between 2.3 and 2.2
===================

* Alter handling of insert mode typing in the line number area to prevent 
  SPFLite interpreting shifted line numbers as numeric operands.  In Insert 
  mode characters will not be inserted unless characters to the right have been 
  deleted previously.   e.g.  Typing a 'D' in position 1 of Line # (000123) 
  used to shift and leave the field as (D00012) - certainly NOT what was 
  desired.  

* Corrections to handling FIND/CHANGE/RCHANGE strings, particularly null quoted 
  strings e.g.  "" 


Between 2.2 and 2.1
===================

* Version 2.2 fixes a the same dumb error in the OPEN / COPY primary commands 
  as 2.1 did for CREATE / REPLACE.  A true embarrassment to have missed it.  

Between 2.1 and 2.0
===================

* Version 2.1 fixes a dumb error related to the CREATE / REPLACE primary 
  commands when they are using the standard Windows 'Save As' dialogue box.  

Between 1.4 and 2.0
===================

* Version 2.0 switches SPFLite from a Console mode application to a normal 
  Windows application.  

* Almost full keyboard customization is now available.  You may re-map nearly 
  all the keyboard control keys as you desire.  

* Some additional mouse support has been added (including MouseWheel support), 
  however SPFLite treats these all as extensions to the basic keyboard 
  functioning.  No change to keyboard operation (other than the new keyboard 
  mapping) has been made.  

* Keyboard mappings and customization of the screen options have been removed 
  from the PROFILE options and are now contained in an optional SPFLite.INI 
  file for easier access and modification.  

* A new RULER option is available to cause a ruler to appear as the top line of 
  the data screen.  

Between 1.3 and 1.4
===================

* Finally, with the assistance of many others in the PowerBasic forums, a way 
  to access the Right-Ctl in SPFLite for use as the SPF Enter key for those who 
  prefer it.  See the new PROFILE option RIGHTCTL for details.  Activating this 
  option also frees up the BKSP key which will now function as a normal PC BKSP 
  key.  

* The mouse can now be clicked anywhere on the screen to quickly move the 
  cursor to that location.  

* A new PROFILE option (AUTOSCROLL) can be turned on which alters the cursor 
  handling within the text data area.  Moving the cursor 'past' a boundary will 
  cause the text data to scroll rather than wrap the cursor to the other side 
  of the screen.  

* The Close button in the Title bar has been re-activated and will be treated 
  as a Primary END command.  

* Pressing Enter with the cursor on an empty command line will now tab 
  properly.  

* Additional aliases for some of the Primary commands have been included.  

* Support is available for altering the command stacking character (default of 
  ;).  See the PROFILE option CMDCHR.  

Between 1.2 and 1.3
===================

* Repeat FIND which reaches the top or bottom (ending in a 'Not Found') will 
  continue from the Top/Bottom as appropriate.  

* Added alias line commands LCC/UCC for Lower/Uppercase line range commands 
  equivalent to LCLC/UCUC.  

* Added support for the Picture type literal in FIND and CHANGE commands 

Between 1.1 and 1.2
===================

* Correction to TF line command re: handling of lines containing quotes and/or 
  double quotes 

Between 1.0 and 1.1
===================

* Correction to primary CUT command in placing data in Windows clipboard.  

* Correct PASTE command of text containing TAB characters (they weren't being 
  expanded).  

* Correct text of PASTE error message.

* Add new PROF option (DEL3270) to provide alternate DELETE key handling.

* PROF command was not displaying the status of the ENDERASE setting.

* Add command line option 'CLIP' to auto Edit/Save the clipboard contents

Between 1.0beta and 1.0
=======================

* Improve Left/Right Scrolling when cursor in actual text area.

* Add link to Help file in Start Menu Group during install.

* Correct extraction of substrings with embedded quotes (like it's).

* Correct Text Flow line command (TF) when paragraph is at bottom of document.

* Make formatting of window title consistent.

* Leave screen position 'as is' after a CUT/PASTE operation rather than TOP.

* Really long file names cause problems (grrr!)

* Correct really nasty Line Repeat errors (mispositioned Cursor, misadjustment 
  of following line commands, etc.) 

* Correct Right scroll when max line length < viewable screen width.

* Support UNIX/Mac style text files (i.e. line endings CRLF/LF/CR)

* Add primary PRINT command.

* Correct 'lost' instruction causing SAVE missing filename errors.

* Correct TF line command when requested flow column > max. line size

* Added CRLF primary command to simplify support for non-WIN format text 
  files.  

* Additional scrolling and cursor positioning cleanup when multiple commands 
  issued in one interaction.  

* Added Pop-Up display of current PROFILE options following any change to the 
  PROFILE.  

* Added Pop-Up display of current PFKEY settings following any PFKEY change.
